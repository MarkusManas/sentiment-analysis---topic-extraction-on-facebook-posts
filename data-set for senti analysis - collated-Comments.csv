It is quickly metabolized, and functions in some ways as an antioxidant. ""    ----> "" In general, tropical oils are much more healthful than oils produced in a cold climate. This is because tropical plants live at a temperature that is close to our natural body temperature. Tropical oils are stable at high temperatures. When we eat tropical oils, they don't get rancid in our tissues as the cold-climate seed oils, such as corn oil, safflower oil and soy oil, do. [R.B. Wolf, J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 59, 230, 1982; R. Wolfe, Chem 121, Univ. of Oregon, 1986.] When added to a balanced diet, coconut oil slightly lowers the cholesterol level, which is exactly what is expected when a dietary change raises thyroid function. This same increase in thyroid function and metabolic rate explains why people and animals that regularly eat coconut oil are lean, and remarkably free of heart disease and cancer. ""    ----->   ""Coconut oil is the least fattening of all the oils. Pig farmers tried to use it to fatten their animals, but when it was added to the animal feed, coconut oil made the pigs lean [See Encycl. Brit. Book of the Year, 1946]. """,4,

""Mabibili o mabubulok"", quoted is the sad truth that haunts our present onion farmers. Morons are those who did not know that onions are highly perishable if not handled or stored properly right after the harvest. Buyers are difficult to be found, as if there is a sort of STOP BUYING, which made it impossible for farmers to immediately dispose their harvest, unlike the previous years.       The markets were seemed closed for our local onion harvest.  Consequences are, the surge of agents which offers storage spaces to prolong the shelf life of the products, until the time wherein justifiable price per kilogram and availability of buyers insued. Storage are additional expenses on the part of the producers, and only few people can afford this option.       What are the leading causes of these phenomena?        This is not the first time that farmers suffer for not being able to earn enough income through their harvest. This law on supply and demand are not being used as a tool,  but as a reason to explain the cause of disappointments and hunger every year.       The near Senatorial elections had diverted the attention of current officials, as well as the public and private sectors, which had caused them to neglect the duties they held on their current positions.        Significantly, the Department of Agriculture which have the principal authority to provide efficient and immediate response, investigation and monitoring on the cause and effect of this problem had done nothing until now. Where should we ask for action? So slow.  DA's failure encourage people to abandon agriculture.       We want profit from our hard work. We work hard to live. We just want better lives.",2,

""Mabibili o mabubulok"", quoted is the sad truth that haunts our present onion farmers. Morons are those who did not know that onions are highly perishable if not handled or stored properly right after the harvest. Buyers are difficult to be found, as if there is a sort of STOP BUYING, which made it impossible for farmers to immediately dispose their harvest, unlike the previous years.       The markets were seemed closed for our local onion harvest.  Consequences are, the surge of agents which offers storage spaces to prolong the shelf life of the products, until the time wherein justifiable price per kilogram and availability of buyers insued. Storage are additional expenses on the part of the producers, and only few people can afford this option.       What are the leading causes of these phenomena?        This is not the first time that farmers suffer for not being able to earn enough income through their harvest. This law on supply and demand are not being used as a tool,  but as a reason to explain the cause of disappointments and hunger every year.       The near Senatorial elections had diverted the attention of current officials, as well as the public and private sectors, which had caused them to neglect the duties they held on their current positions.        Significantly, the Department of Agriculture which have the principal authority to provide efficient and immediate response, investigation and monitoring on the cause and effect of this problem had done nothing until now.

Beyond all the Satanic worship, there are earth changes going on (causing natural disaster) - some are precipitated by few elite world leader/cabal and the most deadly are those cause by PLANET NIBIRU (Revelation 12:3-5 - Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth.) The Planet Nibiru (in it, is a hoards of fallen angels) is already in our solar system coming from a distant places of the Universe. (The sun keep on throwing solar flare but the earth is protected because of magnetic field. With Planet Nibiru approaching earth it gradually distorting the earth's magnetic field and when the Red Dragon is already close enough to earth which is imminent, it will break and tear apart the magnetic field for a while and tremendous solar storm will cause a huge geomagnetic storm on earth which will severely damage world's power grids and satellite system. The earth will experience temporary shutdown of electricity and internet.) Jesus said ""I am not scarring you My children, I am just telling what is to come. A way of escape has been provided. Turn to Me and be save for I am God and there is no other. I formed light and create darkness. In me, there is protection.  Your Time is short, you must be awaken from a very a long sleep in the comfort of you feather beds. If you chose to fight the Lord will go and war with you. But that does mean that there will be no incidents of suffering. It means that I am on your side. I have already withheld several devastating blows because of the prayers of the citizens. I receive repentance as a myrrh, offered in solid gold censers. It is to me the most fragrant sacrifices, even in remembrance of my childhood, the gift of kings - and the Crucifixion. So many have repented and continue to repent daily, I cannot ignore their entreaties. Be ready for me to take you at any moment. Know the condition of your soul before me. Know that you are clean and ready to meet me. Spend time in worship and do not give your heart and mind to useless pursuits. Do not wait until calamity to settle accounts with me. Do not dangle your feet over the fence, but be firmly planted on the right side, not toying with sin. Even though I have work for you for several years still many of you are not ready. Many are caught up in the world and have no idea what could happen to them in the next minute. Therefore, they are not ready for what is coming. Many are putting off their conversion until it is too late. Do not be caught unaware. Do not drag your feet in repenting for your sins. Do not suppose you have tomorrow to do it. Your life could end this very night and if you have been delaying your complete conversion for a pet sin - your soul and destiny are in danger. MY BELOVED ONES, I WAITED FOR YOU DAY AND NIGHT TO SHARE TIME WITH YOU, TO AWAKEN YOUR HEARTS TO MY PASSIONATE LOVE FOR YOU. MOST OF YOU AVOID ME, BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TENDERLY AND COMPLETELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY I LOVE YOU OR I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU. I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT YOUR SHORT-COMINGS, BUT NONETHELESS, YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME. A PRECIOUS CREATION THAT HAS RECOGNIZED HER CREATOR IS BEYOND VALUE TO ME. SO MANY HAVE NOT RECOGNIZED ME, THAT WHEN FINALLY, ONE DOES, MY HEART BURST FOR JOY TO BE IN COMMUNION WITH SUCH A ONE AS THIS. If you really got that, you would not drag your feet coming into prayer. You would not be afraid to work on your faults, because I would say to you, ""Come! let us reason together. These things are too much for you to handle on your own. Let me live through you and help you handle them. Let's do this together, holding hands and working our way through them."" That's my heart - and yet you distance yourself  from Me, because of the false guilt, Satan continually accuses you with. All that matters to Me is that we be reconciled. That you finally find your home in My Heart, never to depart from there. In My heart you hear My voice, feel My emotions, rest in My arms, and be kept from the constant, snapping jaws of wolves and jackals assigned to torment you with false guilt. This is where I want you to be in My heart: Free from disputing , contending, fearing, slinking away in false guilt; free from sin, and continually being kept free from sin. This is your heritage. This is why I died on the cross to obtain it for you. Do not waste anymore time confessing and repenting of your sins; you do not know what tomorrow holds for you. But if you are in Me, you know that my open arms and heart are always in your tomorrows, and you needn't fear the plaque that destroys at noon, nor the terror of the night, nor...",1,

Some of his ideas need to be reviewed (I suggest peer-to-peer review with stakeholders, etc). Checks and balances please.

On this way, we can save water consumptions, regulate production, and develop sustainable market 1st local then global.  2. Establish Agri hub - offer simple investment to our OFWs - we can present details; 3. Logistics - 7,107 islands need logistics. 4. OFWs will always be the Ph Ambassadors of agri crops because they invest on it; 5. Campaign on BUY LOCAL PRODUCE. Label local and imported goods. Agri industry is always a winner.

Mangos are site specific and sweetness are influenced by proper nutrient ( potassium) Mgt and other cultural practices to increase its sweetness.Our carabao or phil mangos grown in Miami are not the sweetest . There are other varieties just as sweet and even sweeter in terms of brix , Alphonso from India and Chaunsa from Pakistan . Our carabao has   it‚Äôs highest brix if grown in guimaras or zambales  due to our soil and climatological conditions unique to us . There are other mangos grown in India , Mexico and Pakistan  that to them is the best and the sweetest .  2 . Our carabao mangoes have a thin skin such that it‚Äôs exportability when it comes to transportability,  handling and proper merchandising may be more cumbersome compare to other varieties like the Ataulfo of Mexico , non doc mai of Thailand and Chaunsa of Pakistan. The window of its highest peak of ripeness for the carabao is too short ( 3-4 days max) compared to Ataulfos that can last for a week , getting sweeter  as they ripe. Carabao looses its flavor just  barely a day or two after reaching its peak . ( Thou research are now underway to address this issue )   3. In any countries there‚Äôs always a limit in what consumers are willing to pay for a piece of mango . Due to long shipping distance from Philippines to Europe and it‚Äôs inherent perishability  our carabao mangos may not just be competitive enough . Mexico grows carabao mangos (Guerrero and Chiapas ) and from what I have tasted is sweeter than what we have in pi.",2,

What I tried to point out here are issues our carabao mangoes would face , once they finally arrived on the shelves of the country importing them .  Issues such as , its inherent quick perishability due to its thin skin , what their final pricing be considering the long distance travelled from pi  and other factors affecting consumers decisions wether to buy our mangos instead of the other varieties.  To me the most compelling issue here would be the final price  of ea. mango  once  it arrives in their final destination in Europe or the Middle East .     I remember in the past decade or so they tried to sell carabao mangos in the us . Price for ea. piece came out to be at $4.  Sold out in the first day (due to excitement ) but no reorder afterwards. At the same time , we‚Äôve heard  comments from our kababayan saying .. why buy a piece of the  carabao mango when you can buy a box of Ataulfo or Kent  mangos for the same price and  are also almost as good  in taste and aroma of the carabao.    Then when  it comes to perishability it is difficult for any produce store  to keep our carabaos longer on the shelves while maintaining it superb flavor and aroma since the peak of ripeness is barely a day or two, after which their flavor have dissipated.",2,

It is sad at galing pa sa ating mga pilipino ang negative reviews & comments.",2,
2201079273307863-96,FALSE,2201079273307863-89,Victor Chico,0,"Denden Galit   there‚Äôs no doubt about our edge  sa taste and overall flavor ng ating carabao and of course those  positive reviews we are getting , with our carabao  mango  would certainly help us push ours  vs other mango varieties in the market.  But these reviews do not translate into actual volume of sales yet  or until such time we start shipping and offering them out to consumers . We don‚Äôt have enough data to say that consumers will prefer carabao mangos over the other varieties on the shelves of their favorite supermarkets.    What I am sharing  to you now is the actual experience of importing and selling carabao mangos grown in Mexico  and the volume of sales  generated from it .   So you know what happened that time  ? ... most of the stocks of the carabao mango became soft  and fully ripened in the warehouse while their skin were still green .Thou the superb taste  and aroma are still there  , they never sold and  sadly all the mangos ended up in the dumpster . The importer lost his shirt that day including his pants  and said never again for carabao mango.  So this is one of the reality of  handling and merchandising carabao mangos  post harvest and at point of destination .  It has nothing to do with management techniques like what you have mentioned.  (Also I don‚Äôt make negative comments without basis .)   Before Dr  Hernani Golez  our known mango expert died in 2009 , I had the chance to discuss with him  some of these issues I was sharing now to everyone , and at that time he was almost done with his new research on controlled atmosphere (CA) storage for our green carabao mangoes. ( With CA  technology  apples in the us can be stored for a year ). This  post harvest technology will prolonged shelf life of our mangoes  when transported over long distances using ocean vessels rather than the prohibitive  cost of air freight . From what he had  disclosed that time he was almost done with  his research , saying that our mangos may now be stored for a longer period of time (10 -14 days ) maintaining their green stage  and arriving at their destination ready to ripen.  So if this is the case now , we still need to find out the final landed cost for a piece of mango to its country of destination using this new technology.",2,

I believe you really have the earnest desire to help our agriculture sector including our mango industry. However, I am frustrated with DA's lack of support to my newly registered Philippine mango, the ""Mangoming"" variety.

So here's my comment in response to your video above...  What about ""Mangoming"" mango variety? Will DA continue to ignore it forever just because it might pose a threat to the existing mango industry?  If only our previous DA officials did not ignore my Mangoming for nine years since i obtained the Guiness World Record certificate as the ""Heaviest mango in the world"" in 2009, the Philippines would have been known not only as having the biggest but also the sweetest mango in the world because the scientist from the University of UP-Los Ba√±os, Laguna after a 3 year study and research were able to prove of my Mangoming's superior quality in 2017 hence the subsequent validation by the NSIC-TWG and registration approval by the council in November 21, 2018.

My request to all of us is to NOT throw the seeds in your rubbish bin, but INSTEAD to wash them, dry them (in the sun) and pack it in newspaper and keep it in your car. Whenever you go out and find an open baren land while travelling, be it on a village road, on an empty motorway, throw these seeds. They will germinate easily in the the coming monsoon.  If with this simple act, we can contribute even a single tree each season to our world, our mission of greening this world would be successful.  The Thai government has been promoting this to all its citizen over the last few years. Many of their other districts officers have been driving this campaign aggressively which has been very successful. The number of fruit trees in the wild have multiplied many times over particularly in the Northern districts of Thailand.
