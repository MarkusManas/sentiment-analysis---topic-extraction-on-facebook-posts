pos - Aedan Licos Government should form an agriculture cluster so DA, DAR, DOST, DENR and DTI will have a synchronized program.
pos - Sana huwag naman lahat magtanim ng rubber baka mag over supply na naman tapos babagsak din ang presyo. It is better for DA to study which crops are better suited to a province. For ex Highland Alfonso Cavite you can plant black pepper and coffee but these are not suitable to other provinces.
neg - Ban the importation of palmoil they are killing the copra farmers.
pos - Bonnie Javier yes I hope so too. But just recently prrd vetoed the bill because I think he saw it is lacking to protect the interest of the farmers  Possible the corrupt will benefit  So it is very important to elect congresman and senators who really think of the people and not how much they can get
pos - Include coco jam spread as another product to promote, as well as the bukayo candies (grated coconut cooked in molasses)
pos - Eto pa ang pinaniniwalaan kong solusyon kesa sa Belga Agro Festival na yan! Gang promotion  lang yan; pupusta ako walang maitutulong yan sa mga magniniyog na Pinoy!

pos - Please include our garlic in this endeavor. Our native ones taste much better even if smaller than Taiwan varieties. Gosh, they come to us heavily bleached.
neg - Mary Ann Dabalos Rabadon mura tlaga tapon ng palm oil ng indonesia at malaysia sa atin kaya nag suffer coco oil,  isa pa sana mismong DA  magkaroon advertisement how good coco oil versus palm oil,  prangkahan na bakit pa pagtakpan ang kaunting ambag ng palm industry mismo dito sa atin

neg - Not only  water  Crisis  Sec  MannyPi√±ol  Philippines  could  FACE Massive  conversion of  Agriculture land owned by  Small  farmers   if low  price  of  Palay  will  prevail
neg - Fuerzas Xycris, that is good for those banana plantations for they have capital, or afford to infuse additional investment. But can the small farmers afford to infuse additional capital? Yung tanim ng small farmers, karamihan, gulay o palay at kunti lang ang inaasahan na kita. Sa tingin mo susugal ng milyon na equipment na reverse osmosis technology para sa maliit nilang sakahin? Ang problema ay hindi ang maliliit na magsasaka, ang problema mga politicians na walang alam na mabisang kasagutan sa problema, kundi puro pansamantalang kalunasan lang. Ito maliban sa mentalidad ng karamihang politicians na yung mananakaw lang ang iniisip.

pos - God bless..
pos - since 2008, i have been promoting also the VIRGIN COCONUT OIL (VCO) and the use of coconut oil for cooking.. I am strongly discouraging Filipinos from using canola oil, palm oil, vegetable oil, soya bean oil as they are highly toxic and have been causing serious health concerns..  VCO helped me get well from my health crisis (ovarian cysts, severe endemetriosis and small myomas).. Philippines is very blessed to be abundant with coconut trees.. DOH, Dept of Education and DA have to work hand in hand in telling the Filipinos about the healthy truth about coconuts.  Sadly, the doctors wont tell this fact to you...on how VCO can heal a lot of serious health concerns...
pos - Work lng ng Work sir Manny.. Thank You for this wonderful Project.

Kaya lang limited po ang scions available from my 5 fruit-bearing Mangoming trees, dahil wala po akong mango plantation.  Hindi ko po kayo mapagbigyan ng sabay sabay.   My Batch 6 of Free Mangoming Scions distribution in 2019 is already fully committed to 800 persons who requested since February to July 2018.  Ayoko pong magpromise na hindi ko matutupad.  However, kung ipahintulot ng Panginoon at buhay pa ako at nandyan pa mga Mangoming trees ko, ay itutuloy ko ang Batch 7 in 2020.  IF YOU are willing to wait that long, I would be glad to include you in my new list.   Just PM your recipient's complete name, address and contact number as required by LBC.  Note: Due to FB 5,000 Friends limit, I could no longer add future Free Mangoming scions recipients as "Friends".

pos - Bong Pinol easier said than done!!! Better stop it!!!
pos - MannyPi√±ol Sec Manny, blessed day po.  Some recommendations po as per actual experience of western market. We need to create or design the system that works for the whole country po. We can easily beat the world market po by 1. Declare Phil Agriculture towards organic farming until 2024 - maximize the use of farm and market wastes to create our own fertilizers; accomplish 20% annually. On this way, we can save water consumptions, regulate production, and develop sustainable market 1st local then global.  2. Establish Agri hub - offer simple investment to our OFWs - we can present details; 3. Logistics - 7,107 islands need logistics. 4. OFWs will always be the Ph Ambassadors of agri crops because they invest on it; 5. Campaign on BUY LOCAL PRODUCE. Label local and imported goods. Agri industry is always a winner. Thank you po sa lahat nang pagsisikap mo at ng buong Kagawaran ng Pagsasaka na mareporma at maiangat ang ating ekonomiya. Send our products abroad and bring back more consumers thru farm tourism are the keys towards economic recovery po.
pos - Dear Sec Manny, just say no to palm oil imports po coz we are looked so stupid already. Don't worry po with our other products because coconut is over production.  Neigboring countries will respect your decisions because you care on our coconut industry.  This is the best NO as an answer po. God bless you po.
pos - I do not understand why coconut oil based cooking oil like Minola are so expensive when the material is plentiful in the country. The Philippines is the world's number one/largest producer of coconut oil.
neg - MannyPi√±ol kung ayaw nila tanggapon bigay nyo na lang po sa amin around 1500-2000 hectares ang benificiaries Sisiman, Lutayan, Sultan Kudarat

pos - Good design sirüôèüèº
pos - This is a good prospect. If Belarus will establish an assembly plant, at least the parts that will come into the country will not be taxed high as compared when the equipment is fully assembled. It will generate employment, and some of the parts can be manufactured locally, which may generate more businesses.
pos - God bless..

pos - You're doing great Sec. Manny Pinol... But we have to plant more coconuts to achieve this... Hope that the organization of oil millers and coconut planters would spend more time in coconut production..
neg - Boe Sison Kathleen Carley April 16, 2017 ¬∑  Change.org  ¬∑  Palm oil is found in nearly everything we eat.When heated to high temperatures when in frying and such it creates cancer causing substances that we find in our foods. Not only is it responsible to the deforestation of our rainforests in order to plant the Palm Oil, the burning cause the release of carbon that stays in the rainforests for hundreds of years. There is nothing good to be found to our use of this oil. Only harmful side effects. We are losing the habitats of the Orangutan and the Sumatran Tigers and Elephants. Not to mention the abuse to the child labor and other indigenous people.

pos - Amazing!
pos - Wow beautiful
pos - Congrats to our DA SECRETARY.  The next challenge for his sub-alterns, undersecretaries and regional heads, is to identify the problems inherently stopping the farmers from exporting. ONce you have discovered the disconnects, and developed solutions, exports would boom. For now, it is too difficult for the small farmers to do. Perhaps the big multinationals will respond to this, capable and empowered they are for many years. But then, sila lang.
neg - Sec. Manny, those critics might have the backing of CPP/NPA or LP, and also rice cartels.  After all, they earned billions of pesos from the rice manipulation two years ago. They will not go down quitely, but slowly those critics are becoming irrelevant.
pos - Happy birthday!!!
pos - Congrats sir on this mammoth project
neg - Grabe talaga ang neglect the government in the past. We have these Cartels that cause suffering to people but previous government just didn‚Äôt mind because most likely some if not most of them benefited from these cartels.  They have become so powerful and weld power from inside the government. Now it‚Äôs a difficult task for current admin to break them!
pos - Coco sap sugar for diabetics need to be promoted as well.

pos - G
pos - Agree
neg - Wala pong over supply... sabay sabay lang nag harvest which is normal kase harvesting season nga. I bet the total harvest will be not enough until the next harvest season. Baka mag import pa tayo. May mga mapagsamantalang trader lang talaga. Sana pinabawi man lang mga farmers ngayon kase last year sobrang lugi dahil sa peste. Ngayon presyo naman tumira kaya lugi pa rin. Sana magkaroon ng systema at patakaran to stabilize our farm produce buying prices. Set a buying price range before the start of the planting season then ENFORCE the price range during the harvesting period. Kaylangan lang pagaralan what will be the lowest and highest price based on production output levels based on worst, average and best conditions. There should be no case na the lowest price be lower than the average cost of production.
pos - interesado po ako ma'am. Please include me po sa batch 7. Maraming salamat po.
pos - Edgardo Herrera ... Thank you sir.   You're one who can vouched for Mangoming para hindi na masabi ni sir Manny na "We don't just promote the propagation of a new variety based on the say-so of one person" Kailangan po pala lahat ng nakatikim mag "say-so" din.

pos - Getting there!!!
pos - Soc Pi√±ol, I think the DA should also embark on massive promotion of coco and other products!
pos - Thank you sir
neg - Increased water yield is not just about planting more trees but creating an environment containing a balanced flora (vegetation) and fauna (animals), insects, microbes, humidity, temperature, topography, etc etc... that would give optimum volume, good quality & perrineal (year-round) water yield.

neg - Sir Manny sa ibang bansa meron sariling irrigation system ang bawat farm. Merong water pump ang well nila kaya walang silang issue kung merong el nino.  At kung merong rain forecast hindi na sila nag e irrigate. Pra tipid sa tubig. Ang nakikita ko lang na kulang sa atin ay pera pang gawa ng sariling pump. Medyo mahal. At tsaka walang forecast specifically each areas. Walang idea mga farmers talaga sa weather forecasting.

pos - Alain R. Alafriz dagdag trabaho. Bugbog na ako.
pos - Yes, we also have thai mangoes in Singapore. They only look bigger but ours is still sweeter by a long shot.
pos - Sec Pinol, one very important input in the growing of coconut trees is salt. Saltmaking or salt production industry must be under DA because saltbeds are used in growing fish during the rainy season. Each coco tree needs about 4kg of salt every year to stay healthy and bear more fruits. Salt is used in livestock and poultry feeds.   Besides DOST which provides some R&D assistance, no government agency is really in charge of ‚Äúsalt‚Äù.   Just imagine the livelihood opportunities we can generate from saltmaking

pos - Mark Arman Aquino it's not too late . Kung paano dumating si Pres. Duterte sa buhay natin ganoon din si DA Manny Pi√±ol sa mga farmers....
pos - The flavor profile of the Philippines mango is unque. Pinol should file for a DNA rights over Philippines mango, and file for a certficate of origin like the French does with its products, e.e. wine, cheese, etc.  Already, the Philippines mango was "smuggled" to Mexico. I think this was sourced from a Mango plantation project in Guam undertaken jointly by a company owned by Gil Puyat Jr. and then Gov Calvo of Guam. The project was scuttled but the mango trees remained in situ and became the root stock of the very popular ataulfo mango.
pos - technology for sustainability

That way you can help us farmers. Stop protecting the businessmen/oil millers in the Philippines. It is futile to continue on a system where in farmers are the one being sacrifice </3

Ang gas nuon mura pa. Ang palmoil ay every 10days harvest na. Hinde pa mainit . May kambing ka pa as alternative income . 1 to 2 years ma intercrop mo pa ng saging or mais. Sa ngayon ang presyo 280 to 340 n lang. Samantala yon ang nagpaasenso sa malaysia at indonesia.
neg - Sir Sana sa probinsya Ng Occ. Mindoro magkaroon din Ng ganyan.. the province of OCC mindoro is one of the biggest producer of rice, corn, onion, etc. Farmers deserve to receive like govt assistance...

pos - GOD bless you sir manny. GOD bless Philippines.
pos - Sir. Our weakness is marketing. Agriculture needs strong market linkages, good packing and processing plants, appropriate logistics and good standards. Ours has always been Production-led Agri, while our neighbors Thailand and Vietnam have strong Market-driven agriculture. We have to re-make our bureaucracy to be Market-driven, properly staffed and engaged, with strong salesmanship for worldwide marketing.
pos - Zeno Ryujin Yes, the worst plague that happened in the country. Weather is God given to balance the earth and all that‚Äôs needed is find the solution that is always there but blinded by corruption for personal greed.
pos - We can also adopt the technology of Israel.. Despite of weather and soil conditions they are still able to cultivate and produce crops.. Its amazing how they do it.. If they can, why can't the Philippines do?
pos - Sec Emmanuel Pinol, the GREED of capitalists know no bounds.  They are just thinking of huge profits on the backs of the onion  farmers whose produce will be bought at even less than production costs.    Thank you for all your timely interventions to prevent their continuous exploitation of our onion farmers.

But lets try to put ourselves to d shoe of our minimum wage earner consumers, pumupunta sa supermarket, naghanap ng mantika, nakita coconut product from Philippines at 135.00 per liter. On the other side my imported high quality cooking oil at 90.00 per liter... what u think the customer prefers to buy... by d way sir, do u know that buying price of Copra now is at 15.00 per kilo? But coconut consumer pack oil were sold at 130+ per liter?

neg - Palm oil imports should be totally stopped, only the capitalists are benefiting. Filipino farmers are the one affected. We should first consume our domestic produce of palm and coco oil before importing. Looks like there is economic sabotage going on.
pos - Victor Chico at least lesser burden to farmers if NIA are no longer collecting fees. About technical works , we have other govt  agencies like DA , NIA, DENR , LGUs , and others to help the farmers.

pos - Repost Dear Friends, Will you please post and help me forward this message to all your other groups so that it gets circulated, thanks. Soon the season of fruits like mango, durians, rambutans, langsat (lansones), duku, mangosteen, jack fruit, etc will be here. My request to all of us is to NOT throw the seeds in your rubbish bin, but INSTEAD to wash them, dry them (in the sun) and pack it in newspaper and keep it in your car. Whenever you go out and find an open baren land while travelling, be it on a village road, on an empty motorway, throw these seeds. They will germinate easily in the the coming monsoon.  If with this simple act, we can contribute even a single tree each season to our world, our mission of greening this world would be successful.  The Thai government has been promoting this to all its citizen over the last few years. Many of their other districts officers have been driving this campaign aggressively which has been very successful. The number of fruit trees in the wild have multiplied many times over particularly in the Northern districts of Thailand.  Let‚Äôs us also join the Thais in this brilliant initiative to spread abundance in nature and in this simple yet effective way and contribute back to our next generations. Please forward to all groups...

pos - Bakit hindi natin magawa. Filipino agriculturists and foresters, etc. nasa hotels nag seminar.  In the US they (professionals and scientists) honed their ideas on the field, they cultivate their lands.  In the Philippines, government entrusted to the lowly Peoples Organizations the projects wthout science-based assistance. ‚úåÔ∏èüòë

pos - Wow....d best sir pinol
pos - Don't just be amazed... get their secret...
pos - I still believe Sir MannyPi√±ol that  parallel to this brilliant recommendation of yours is another measure which has been promoted and applied by DA-BSWM since  Marcos administration ---  the Artificial Rain making or cloud seeding. It is about time that it should be institutionalized. You are right in saying that this drought problem of the country which is worsening as we all know should be addressed by making use of the enemy's strength ( El Ni√±o) itself. We must seed the clouds both the warm and cold clouds.  Our neighbor Thailand has been doing it the past 40-50 years yet we are not doing it.    There are budgetary concerns about this I understand but this is an investment or a program that has been proven many times. I understand that there are oppositors on  this program esp the mango growers on the other hand thia is a welcome thing to palay farmers .  Indeed there is a need to strike a balance on this. Maybe it is about time to really recommend properly zoning system of our farming sector just like what Thailand has done.
pos - Very good

pos - While we export great Philippine mangoes we are left with shitty ones to eat if people could afford it. We keep on exporting and making the oligarchic landlords wealthier. Please make a way for the common filipinos to have better access to quality and inexpensive fruits. In that way filipino consumers and farmers will have more quality of life.
neg - Gloria Ili Segaya Ganun po dapat gawin ng lahat ng farmers pati schools para matuto ang mga bata.. sayang ang ulan gift from heaven. Ang tanging hurdle lang naman nun ay ang dengue and other mosquito borne diseases na dapat ma-address sa implementation.
pos - Maybe you could also concentrate on making Philippine mango affordable for people living in the Philippines. Additional exports will just drive higher prices here.

Government should find ways, make innovations in our coconut industry. Find more lucrative products out from our coconut. If not, we will just cut off our coconuts and replace it with other crops that can bring better income to our farmers.
