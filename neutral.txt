then let the government build cold storages which would then handed down to the farmerâ€™s coop
Earliest onion planting season starts by the month of October, and import permits and licenses for onion importations were cheered to a stop via fb post made last March 22?  That was too late. It has no effect on the current situation.

There is a study in the Uk,the show is Trust me Im a doctor..Coconut oil boost the level of good cholesterol and lower the level of vad bad cholesterol  compare to olive oil..olive oil do nothing..it doesnt add up bad cholesterol which is good but it doesn't boost good cholesterol level..
yes. the EU is cutting their importation of palm oil.
Jobs Bantayan the best way is to ban the importation of palm oil. Imposing huge tax will only increase their market price on us.
Rose Tan correct coconut oil is a very healthy oil  in our body . Instead that we're using any kind of cooking oil we use our own  very organic coconut oil for cooking.Her in abroad the vegetarian people they are using coconut oil for cooking.
Just provide us with coco oil press machine and we'll be fine.

Open more export market , it is a billion dollar industry before.
Going beyond our borders to promote and open new markets for ph coconut products will take time and it will have no immediate impact on the current price of copra. A localized business model and a small gvt subsidy will do the trick.
Time to beyond buko juice and copra by developing more high value coconut-based products that can increase farmers' incomes and open more markets for them.
sir dito sa amin the buying price is still at 8-10/kilo...
Lots of using palm oil, canola. Corn oil in exchange of coconut oil may its also a reason.
Farmers sell butong rather than copra until such time worth it na mo produce ug copra. Dili lalim mag copra sir nya 20 ra ang kilo..ang datu mosamot ka datu.

MannyPiÃ±ol this is a good short term solution but how about making incentive to cooperative to build permanent cold storage facility. Do we have budget there? We have to fix a long term solution now because we never know the next admin if he/she will be a farm oriented person.
The government should use the million of funds it gets in providing buying centers that will   buy farmers produce the right amount. Traders cant manipulate prices if govt can buy them.
sec sana controlled nalang po ng DA at DTI  ang pricing from farm to market

Talhal Bai si pnoy sasagot ng tanong mo hahaha.
May nabasa at napanood din po ako dati sa youtube na pilipino scientist na nagligo sa river kung saan may nuclear power plant, ininum pa nga po niya yung tubig na sinasabi niyang safe ang nuclear.  May nabasa rin po ako na ang nuclear plant ng korea ay base sa nuclear plant ng pilipinas. Wala namang nangyayaring masama sa korea.  Narinig ko din sa isang speech ni atty gadon na isusulong niya ang pag baba ng kuryete gamit ang nuclear power plant. Sana wag siyang maging trapo at mapako ang pangako.  Nuclear is the answer for our electrical needs as late president marcos once said.
Vincent Anthony Palisoc tama kahit ang location ng nuclear power plant ng America nasa git a mismo ng city..
Gilbert Gorospe ....di lang forest pati irrigated rice land na e convert nila.
Maybe, Sec Emmanuel Pinol, we may also include 1) drip agriculture  2) planting rice varieties that do not need much water 3) water treatment plants 4) stronger sanctions for violation of water catchment facilities required of every barangay/ household. Thank you!
Clarita Carlos add na rin po maam ang pagsira o blockage ng mga irrigation canals due to conversion of lands to non-agri uses.
Build more dam and water reservoirs.
Items 1 & 2 could be lumped into a comprehensive watershed management program and create a separate bureau, authority or any entity to manage it in coordination with LGUs.

Im not saying its na its bad, pero lets evaluate the ups and downs. Wala tayong massive desert like California and Israel.
