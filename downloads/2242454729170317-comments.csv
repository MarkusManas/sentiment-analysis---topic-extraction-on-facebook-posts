But i notice a new trend in  Europe or germany  itself , people are very conscious of healthy living.a lot cut their consumption of meat, I'm one of them too. A lot of vegan products are now sold ... And i found something that might be interesting to Philippine farmers. Jackfruit unripe in chunks are being sold here for vegans .. the store where i bought it is a chain huge company in whole Germany. I myself stirfry it with tofu..and spices.. Really very delicious. THe thing is i remember that in phil.we have also breadfruit...which for sure also when unriped can be used as meat substitute.
