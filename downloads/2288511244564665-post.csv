2288511244564665,May 17 at 9:29 AM,MannyPi√±ol, Tale of two rich Tugades!  THE CABSEC IS A BILLIONAIRE; FARMER HAS HEART OF GOLD  On Friday, in a remote village in Kabacan town, North Cotabato, I met a farmer with a heart of gold named Rolando Tugade.  Farmer Tugade has a 40-hectare property with a small lake which he turned into a small water impounding system to irrigate 50 hectares of his neighbours rice farms.  He has also allowed 30 families belonging to the Blaan tribe displaced by the conflict to stay and farm in his area without getting any share from the crops.  When I told him that he could be related to my friend, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, he bowed his head apparently humbled.  "Mayaman man yon Sir. Mahiya man tayo magsabi na kamag-anak natin yon," Rolly Tugade said.  Indeed, Sec. Tugade is rich. In fact, he is among the richest members of the Cabinet including Public Works Secretary Mark Villar and Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez.  But I told farmer Tugade that he could actually be richer than the Transportation Secretary because he has a heart of gold.  I told Rolly Tugade that I will inform the Transportation Secretary that he has relatives in my province he could truly be proud of.  @ArtTugade. Boss, ang bait ng kamaganak mo.  (File photo of Sec.
