PH ONION, SHALOT FARMERS SET FOR INDONESIA EXPORT  By Manny Pi単ol  The Philippines, which for years has relied mainly on imported Onion both for household and commercial uses, is now all set to make its first export of white and red Bulb Onion and Shalots to Indonesia.  Filipino Onion and Shalot farmers met last week with a representative of Indonesian companies, Deeda Pama, to present samples of the export-quality Onion and Shalots produced in Nueva Ecija this season.  The meeting, facilitated by the Department of Agriculture (DA), was attended by Onion farmers from Central Luzon, Cagayan Valley, Mindoro and Iloilo which are the main production areas for Onion and Shalots in the country.  DA Undersecretary for Operations Ariel Cayanan, Asst. Secretary for Agribusiness and Marketing Andrew Villacorta, Field Operations Director Roy Abaya, Agribusiness and Marketing Director Bernadette San Juan and other top officials of the department conducted the business engagement between the farmers and Deeda Pama.  During the meeting, the requirements and protocols set by Indonesia for the export of Onion and Shalots were discussed.  Samples were also submitted by the farmers which will be shipped to Indonesia through the Department of Foreign Affairs Philippine Embassy in Jakarta.  Jakarta-based Filipino investment and management consultant N Mark Castro conducted the ground work in Indonesia and linked up with prospective importers.  The re-opening of the Indonesian market for Philippine Onion and Shalots, including Bananas, came after the Bilateral Meeting between Indonesian Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita and Philippine Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez and Agriculture Secretary Manny Pi単ol in Manila last month.  The Philippines used to export Shalots to Indonesia but this stopped when production of Onion and Shalots dropped making the country dependent on imports.  The DA through Undersecretary Evelyn Lavi単a who handles High Value Crops Program (HVCP) focused on the revival of the Onion Industry by first crafting the Philippine Onion Industry Road Map.  Loaning programs were also extended to Onion farmers allowing them to expand their productio areas, dramatically increasing local production to satisfy household requirements after just two years of the Duterte Administration.  The DA had to address the problem of bumper harvest which resulted in a drop in the buying price from P30 to as low as P10 per kilo.  As the DA projects another bumper harvest next year, it has earmarked loan funds which Onion farmers group could access to build their own cold storage facilities.  At least 10 cold storage facilities are lined up for establishment in the Onion production areas this year.  Onion production now supplies 70% of the country's total requirements but this volume is already sufficient for household needs.  For 2020, the DA targets to produce 90% of the country's total requirements and aims to achieve 100% self-sufficiency by the end of the term of President Rody Duterte.  #KungGustoMaramingParaan! #KayaNatinBastaMagtulongan!
