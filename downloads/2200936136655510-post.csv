ICONIC BELARUS TRACTOR EYES PH ASSEMBLY PLANT  Minsk, Belarus - The giant Minsk Tractor Works, makers of the iconic Belarus farm tractor, has decided to enter the Philippine market and establish an assembly plant following assurances by the Department of Agriculture that the administration of President Rody Duterte ensures ease of doing business without corruption.  The Belarus is one of the most popular Eastern European farm tractors which has sold almost 3-million units all over the world since the establishment of the factory before World War II.  It has not penetrated the Philippine market in spite of previous attempts, however, because of the tedious government procurement process in the past, according to Alexandre Badytchyk, deputy head of the commercial department of the commercial department.  Assured that the Duterte Administration has initiated a campaign to check corruption in government, especially in the procurement of equipment, machinery and supplies, Minsk Tractor Works officials said they will immediately send a delegation to the Philippines to scout for possible local distributors.  They said that they will consider the establishment of an assembly plant in the Philippines, just like what the company did in Cambodia.  The Minsk Tractor Works said opening up an assembly plant could make the company more competitive in the sale of their farm tractors.  It could also provide employment to Filipino engineers and skilled workers.  The Minsk Tractor Works, whose main manufacturing plant is in a 150-hectare area in the heart of Minsk, employs over 30,000 people.  The company manufactures garden tractors with 15 horsepower to the giant tractors that they export to the rest of Europe and Africa.  #EmploymentOpportunitiesOpened! #ForeignDirectInvestments!
