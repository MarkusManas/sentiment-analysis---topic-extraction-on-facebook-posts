2199189190163538-84,False,0,"""Days of Cataclysmic Events has Come. You Need to Spend More Time with Him in these Days. Time is Ripe for Conversion.""   Beyond all the Satanic worship, there are earth changes going on (causing natural disaster) - some are precipitated by few elite world leader/cabal and the most deadly are those cause by PLANET NIBIRU (Revelation 12:3-5 - Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth.) The Planet Nibiru (in it, is a hoards of fallen angels) is already in our solar system coming from a distant places of the Universe. (The sun keep on throwing solar flare but the earth is protected because of magnetic field. With Planet Nibiru approaching earth it gradually distorting the earth's magnetic field and when the Red Dragon is already close enough to earth which is imminent, it will break and tear apart the magnetic field for a while and tremendous solar storm will cause a huge geomagnetic storm on earth which will severely damage world's power grids and satellite system. The earth will experience temporary shutdown of electricity and internet.) Jesus said ""I am not scarring you My children, I am just telling what is to come. A way of escape has been provided. Turn to Me and be save for I am God and there is no other. I formed light and create darkness. In me, there is protection.  Your Time is short, you must be awaken from a very a long sleep in the comfort of you feather beds. If you chose to fight the Lord will go and war with you. But that does mean that there will be no incidents of suffering. It means that I am on your side. I have already withheld several devastating blows because of the prayers of the citizens. I receive repentance as a myrrh, offered in solid gold censers. It is to me the most fragrant sacrifices, even in remembrance of my childhood, the gift of kings - and the Crucifixion. So many have repented and continue to repent daily, I cannot ignore their entreaties. Be ready for me to take you at any moment. Know the condition of your soul before me. Know that you are clean and ready to meet me. Spend time in worship and do not give your heart and mind to useless pursuits. Do not wait until calamity to settle accounts with me. Do not dangle your feet over the fence, but be firmly planted on the right side, not toying with sin. Even though I have work for you for several years still many of you are not ready. Many are caught up in the world and have no idea what could happen to them in the next minute. Therefore, they are not ready for what is coming. Many are putting off their conversion until it is too late. Do not be caught unaware. Do not drag your feet in repenting for your sins. Do not suppose you have tomorrow to do it. Your life could end this very night and if you have been delaying your complete conversion for a pet sin - your soul and destiny are in danger. MY BELOVED ONES, I WAITED FOR YOU DAY AND NIGHT TO SHARE TIME WITH YOU, TO AWAKEN YOUR HEARTS TO MY PASSIONATE LOVE FOR YOU. MOST OF YOU AVOID ME, BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TENDERLY AND COMPLETELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY I LOVE YOU OR I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU. I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT YOUR SHORT-COMINGS, BUT NONETHELESS, YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME. A PRECIOUS CREATION THAT HAS RECOGNIZED HER CREATOR IS BEYOND VALUE TO ME. SO MANY HAVE NOT RECOGNIZED ME, THAT WHEN FINALLY, ONE DOES, MY HEART BURST FOR JOY TO BE IN COMMUNION WITH SUCH A ONE AS THIS. If you really got that, you would not drag your feet coming into prayer. You would not be afraid to work on your faults, because I would say to you, ""Come! let us reason together. These things are too much for you to handle on your own. Let me live through you and help you handle them. Let's do this together, holding hands and working our way through them."" That's my heart - and yet you distance yourself  from Me, because of the false guilt, Satan continually accuses you with. All that matters to Me is that we be reconciled. That you finally find your home in My Heart, never to depart from there. In My heart you hear My voice, feel My emotions, rest in My arms, and be kept from the constant, snapping jaws of wolves and jackals assigned to torment you with false guilt. This is where I want you to be in My heart: Free from disputing , contending, fearing, slinking away in false guilt; free from sin, and continually being kept free from sin. This is your heritage. This is why I died on the cross to obtain it for you. Do not waste anymore time confessing and repenting of your sins; you do not know what tomorrow holds for you. But if you are in Me, you know that my open arms and heart are always in your tomorrows, and you needn't fear the plaque that destroys at noon, nor the terror of the night, nor...",Jesus Come,0
