2196167813799009,March 22 at 9:58 AM,MannyPiñol, New DA directive   NO ONION IMPORTATION PENDING CARTEL PROBE  By Manny Piñol  The Department of Agriculture (DA) will suspend the importation of Bulb Onions pending the results of the investigation of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) and the National Bureau of Investigation into the reported operations of a cartel manipulating the buying price of locally-produced Onion.   This would prevent the cartel from benefitting from their operations where they forced the drop in the buying price of local onions by leasing and closing cold storage facilities tp onion farmers.  The DA on Wednesday asked the PCC and NBI to investigate reports that trading firms have closed down four major cold storage facilities in an apparent attempt to force farmers to sell at low prices.  The traders are expected to consolidate the local production as they await for the time when they will be allowed to import.  With the farmers' produce bought at very low prices cornered and consolidated, traders could control the pricing of Onion in the market and generate huge profits.  Under an arrangement agreed between farmers groups and the importers, the importation of Onions would only be done after the harvest of the local onions.  The DA has directed the Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) to support the arrangement by scheduling the processing of Sanitary and Pytho-Sanitary permits until after the harvest season.  The BPI has reported that no SPS permits have been issued since October.  The moratorium on the issuance of SPS permits will be extended until such time the PCC and NBI have terminated their investigation.  All agencies under the DA are notified to implement this directive.  #UCantEatUrOwnCake! #TamaNaAngPananamantala!
