2205352789547178,March 28 at 4:23 AM,MannyPiñol, Oversupply, smuggling  PH, INDO, MALAYSIA AGREE TO SETTLE PALM OIL ISSUE  By Manny Piñol  The Philippine Department of Agriculture and its ASEAN-neighbors Malaysia and Indonesia yesterday agreed to form a Tri-Partite Technical Working to address the smuggling dumping of Palm Oil into the Philippines hurting Coconut farmers.  The agreement was reached yesterday following a call by Malaysian and Indonesian government representatives on the Philippine Secretary of Agriculture.  The DA had earlier recommended a temporary ban on Palm Oil importation from Indonesia and Malaysia citing figures whicj indicate dumping of the commodity which led to the collapse of local coconut prices.  Importation data gathered by the DA showed that exports of Palm Oil to the Philippines by both Indonesia and Malaysia have increased by 100% over the last three years.  Since Palm Oil is cheaper than coconut oil, the increase in Palm Oil exports was cited one of  the reasons behind the collapse of copra prices.  During yesyerday's meeting, it wad agreed that the Technical Working Group will draft recommendations on the rationalization of Palm Oil exports to the Philippines.  The DA Secretary suggested the following:  1. Keeping Palm Oil exports by Malaysia and Indonesia at levels which would not hurt the Philippine Coconut and local Oil Palm Industry;  2. For Malaysia and Indonesia  to check on reports of the smuggling of Crude and Refined Palm Oil to the Philippines;  3. For Malaysia and Indonesia to open up their markets to Philippine products, especially coconut based products, to correct the trade imbalance.  The TWG is expected to be organized next week.  #DapatPatasAngLaban! #YouSellToUsWeSellToYou!  (Photos by Larry Nuestro DA-AFID)
