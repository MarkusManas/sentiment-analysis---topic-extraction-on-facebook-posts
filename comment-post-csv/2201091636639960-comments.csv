2201091636639960-1,False,0,"Sir MannyPiñol, good day po! I believe you really have the earnest desire to help our agriculture sector including our mango industry. However, I am frustrated with DA's lack of support to my newly registered Philippine mango, the ""Mangoming"" variety.   I have posted about it in your Page when you were newly appointed as DA Secretary in May 2016  but sadly it never merited your attention as I got no response from you.  So here's my comment in response to your video above...  What about ""Mangoming"" mango variety? Will DA continue to ignore it forever just because it might pose a threat to the existing mango industry?  If only our previous DA officials did not ignore my Mangoming for nine years since i obtained the Guiness World Record certificate as the ""Heaviest mango in the world"" in 2009, the Philippines would have been known not only as having the biggest but also the sweetest mango in the world because the scientist from the University of UP-Los Baños, Laguna after a 3 year study and research were able to prove of my Mangoming's superior quality in 2017 hence the subsequent validation by the NSIC-TWG and registration approval by the council in November 21, 2018. Four months have passed and no news about it was disseminated from national down to regional and local DA, BPI and LGU Agriculture offices for propagation and distribution to all Filipinos as I have been offering its scions for free.",Maria Socorro Modequillo Bodiongan,27

What about the needs of those ordinary Filipinos who are not into mango production/exportation business? They are no longer covered by the services of our Department of Agriculture?  Help in the propagation lang ang hiningi ko para konti ang wastage ng valuable Mangoming scions. Magkano lang ba Cost of propagation per seedling?

The impact would be enormous but to date there is minimal support compared to what Thai farms receive and I am not referring to monetary support rather technology and shared facilities.The research station on Guimaras is not properly funded and they have only very basic facilities unworthy of a nation that produces the best mango in the world.There have been no deep wells drilled on Guimaras and water is a major obstacle, the future could be so bright for the farmers yet they can only dream of access to international markets despite frequent press announcements.Japan and Korea now want only organic fresh mango and other countries will follow.At Kokomojo Mango Farm we will be fully organic his year and we want to work in collaboration with other on Guimaras to build a credible export capability.",Les Blair,0

We are so PRODUCTION-LED that we insist on producing more but we are not MARKET-DRIVEN that we cant connect the dots. The foreign markets have standards to meet in packing, appearance, documentation, certifications, etc.  I dont understand we have been repeatedly stating that we need THE VHT and WHT machines to allow phytosanitary inspection certificates for these mangoes, that they are pest and fly-free, but despite repeated and multiple Mango Congress tackling this issue, wala pa rin.  WE must now turn into MARKET -DRIVEN for our farmers, so we can do market linkage.  We can spend and spend budgets for seminars, trainings, summits etc. repeatedly but if we do not do what the market standards and needs, it will be just a waste of our farmers' time and moneys.

The project was scuttled but the mango trees remained in situ and became the root stock of the very popular ataulfo mango.",Adagulfo Sungcal,0
