The farmers and fishermen do not have the capital to invest in equipment to expand their business.   I admire the DA's efforts but let's not forget that the secretary is an academic. He isn't a business person. His ideas, though idealistic, lack the foresight and the practicality for real world application. Some of his ideas need to be reviewed (I suggest peer-to-peer review with stakeholders, etc). Checks and balances please. Some of these ideas do not deserve to be implemented unless such ideas have value in the real world. Otherwise, the department will be wasting taxpayers money. (Example: coconut bricks.

You can do this by growing cover crops which also enrich your soil. Organic matter also feeds your soil, helps soil life perform many important roles which serve your plants and conserves moisture. Also, avoid digging your soil as much as possible as this damages soil structure and cause SOM loss.
