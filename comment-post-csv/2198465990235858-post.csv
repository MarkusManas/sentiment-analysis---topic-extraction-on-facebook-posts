All the SPIS units will use modern Israeli technology for Solar-Powered Irrigation Systems, a new program adopted by the Department of Agriculture.  The LR Group, one of the biggest agro-industrial companies of Israel, has offered a P44-B loan to establish 6,200 units of Solar-Powered Irrigation Systems to serve 500,000 hectares of farms all over the country.  To show their interest, the LR Group offered to showcase modern Israeli technology in Solar Irrigation by building and donating two units.  The LR Group, represented by Doron Retter together with the Regional Agricultural Engineering Department of Region IV-A CALABARZON, conducted detailed topographic survey of the sites feasible for SPIS in Lumban last week.   Two sites were identified in Lumban, Laguna, an open source(Lumban River) designed for 10ha service area and a Shallow Tube Well (STW) powered by diesel pump covering 3 ha of service area to be converted to Solar-Powered  Pump.  In six weeks, the prototype now being assembled in Israelwill be available for testing and will be shipped here in the Philippines for installation.  Last Wednesday, the High-Level Meeting on Water attended by agencies of government endorsed the Solar-Powered Irrigation System to protect farmers from the adverse effects of droughts and El Niño.  #AyawItoNgPolitikoNgCotabato! #IsraelADesertRemember!
