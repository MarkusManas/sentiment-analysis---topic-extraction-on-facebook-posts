The aggressive campaign is aimed at taking a bite of the previously unexplored market of 180-million people which was opened only following the visit by President Rody Duterte to Moscow in May 2017.  In two bilateral meetings with officials of the Agriculture Ministry of Belarus and the Russian Federation over the weekend, the Department of Agriculture also signed implementing agreements aimed at strengthening its agricultural trade with the two countries.  The first event which will be participated in by the Philippines will be the Belarus Agro Expo or Bel-Agro which is traditionally participated in over 20 Eastern European countries.  Set up in a 25-hectare complex, Bel-Agro is considered as one of the biggest Agricultural Expos in Eastern Europe.  In September, the Philippines will field a huge delegation of its agricultural producers to the World Food Expo of Moscow.  The Department of Agriculture is supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs through its Embassy in the Russian Federation and the Department of Trade and Industry through its commercial attache based in Moscow.  Among the products lined up for presentation are:  - Coconut Oil-based products, including Coco Sugar, Coco Syrup, Virgin Coconut Oil, Desiccated Coconut, Activated Carbon and Green Coconuts;  - Banana, including other banana-based products such as Banana Catsup and Banana Flour;  - Mango, Pineapple and other tropical fruits;  - Cacao and Coffee beans and other processed products;  - Fisheries products, including canned Tuna, bottled sardines, dried fish, carrageenan, shrimps and others.  Philippine Ambassador to the Russian Federation, including Belarus, Carlos D. Sorreta, is now laying the ground works for the Philippine participation in the two major food expos.  Prior to its participation in the major food expos, the DA will launch a massive information and media campaign to present the products from the Philippines.  Television shows featuring food and other agricultural products will be tapped in introducing the new products, especially coconut.  #MarketingCompletesAgriProcess! #KungMayTiyagaMayNilaga! #BukasMayUmagangDarating!
