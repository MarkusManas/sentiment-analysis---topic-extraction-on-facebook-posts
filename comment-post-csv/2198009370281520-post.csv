2198009370281520,March 23 at 3:18 PM,MannyPiñol, P200-M working capital!   DA GIVES FARMERS FUNDS TO BUY ONION PRODUCTION  By Manny Piñol  The Department of Agriculture (DA) will provide Onion Farmers Associations with working capital to be used in buying their members' produce to protect them the price manipulation by traders.  The DA Secretary has also ordered Director Roy Abaya of DA Field Operations to source reefer vans which could be used as temporary storage facilities for the farmers Onion production.  These twin moves were in response to the recommendations made by Task Force Allium to neutralize the manipulation by traders of the Onion pricing as harvest comes into full swing.  Just like in its program to support coconut farmers facing low prices of Copra, the DA will provide an initial working capital of P200-M through the Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC).  The working capital could be used in buying the farmers Onion production which could be kept in reefer vans to be released to the market when prices have stabilized.  The Working Capital could be released as soon as the farmers groups have bern validated and provided with reefer vans.   Earlier, the DA asked the Philippine Competition Commission and the National Bureau of Investigation to probe reports that at least four cold storage facilities have been leased in advance by traders and closed to force farmers to sell at low prices.  The DA has also ordered that there will be no importation permits issued until after the investigation on alleged manipulation by traders.  #TamaNaAngPagsasamantala!
