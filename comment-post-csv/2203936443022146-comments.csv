2203936443022146-2,False,0,"Lo and behold, watch for the downfall of rice production in more conversion of rice lands to subdivision. Rice enhancement fund will only benefit the traders of agricultural machineries to be purchased by the government. Why inrease production of palay if it will be purchased at lower cost? Based on the prevailing farm gate price of palay which is now at 15 Php to 17 Php per kilo, compared to 20 Php to 25 Php per kilo before rice tarification, the average of 100 cav per h.a. yield, opportunity lost to farmers is around 250 per cavan or approximately P25, 000.00 per h.a. This will even be more as yields per hec now reaches 140 to 160 cav. per hec. How about that? RICE FARMERS ARE IN THE LOSING END OF THE TARIFFICATION LAW!",Paul Tiu,0
