We need to create or design the system that works for the whole country po. We can easily beat the world market po by 1. Declare Phil Agriculture towards organic farming until 2024 - maximize the use of farm and market wastes to create our own fertilizers; accomplish 20% annually. On this way, we can save water consumptions, regulate production, and develop sustainable market 1st local then global.  2. Establish Agri hub - offer simple investment to our OFWs - we can present details; 3. Logistics - 7,107 islands need logistics. 4. OFWs will always be the Ph Ambassadors of agri crops because they invest on it; 5. Campaign on BUY LOCAL PRODUCE. Label local and imported goods. Agri industry is always a winner.

2201079273307863-89,False,0,"I‚Äôve handled mangos for a while in the  US , a decade  at least .  Coming out of the mango growing regions of Mexico from Chiapas Nayarit n siniloa  and exported into the USA and Canada . Also I owned and operated mango orchard, along with my farming friends and fellow agriculturist in homestead Florida .  Here‚Äôs what I can share :   1. Mangos are site specific and sweetness are influenced by proper nutrient ( potassium) Mgt and other cultural practices to increase its sweetness.Our carabao or phil mangos grown in Miami are not the sweetest . There are other varieties just as sweet and even sweeter in terms of brix , Alphonso from India and Chaunsa from Pakistan . Our carabao has   it‚Äôs highest brix if grown in guimaras or zambales  due to our soil and climatological conditions unique to us . There are other mangos grown in India , Mexico and Pakistan  that to them is the best and the sweetest .  2 . Our carabao mangoes have a thin skin such that it‚Äôs exportability when it comes to transportability,  handling and proper merchandising may be more cumbersome compare to other varieties like the Ataulfo of Mexico , non doc mai of Thailand and Chaunsa of Pakistan. The window of its highest peak of ripeness for the carabao is too short ( 3-4 days max) compared to Ataulfos that can last for a week , getting sweeter  as they ripe. Carabao looses its flavor just  barely a day or two after reaching its peak . ( Thou research are now underway to address this issue )   3. In any countries there‚Äôs always a limit in what consumers are willing to pay for a piece of mango . Due to long shipping distance from Philippines to Europe and it‚Äôs inherent perishability  our carabao mangos may not just be competitive enough . Mexico grows carabao mangos (Guerrero and Chiapas ) and from what I have tasted is sweeter than what we have in pi.",Victor Chico,12

Issues such as , its inherent quick perishability due to its thin skin , what their final pricing be considering the long distance travelled from pi  and other factors affecting consumers decisions wether to buy our mangos instead of the other varieties.  To me the most compelling issue here would be the final price  of ea. mango  once  it arrives in their final destination in Europe or the Middle East .     I remember in the past decade or so they tried to sell carabao mangos in the us . Price for ea. piece came out to be at $4.  Sold out in the first day (due to excitement ) but no reorder afterwards. At the same time , we‚Äôve heard  comments from our kababayan saying .. why buy a piece of the  carabao mango when you can buy a box of Ataulfo or Kent  mangos for the same price and  are also almost as good  in taste and aroma of the carabao.

2201079273307863-96,False,2201079273307863-89,"Denden Galit   there‚Äôs no doubt about our edge  sa taste and overall flavor ng ating carabao and of course those  positive reviews we are getting , with our carabao  mango  would certainly help us push ours  vs other mango varieties in the market.  But these reviews do not translate into actual volume of sales yet  or until such time we start shipping and offering them out to consumers . We don‚Äôt have enough data to say that consumers will prefer carabao mangos over the other varieties on the shelves of their favorite supermarkets.    What I am sharing  to you now is the actual experience of importing and selling carabao mangos grown in Mexico  and the volume of sales  generated from it .   So you know what happened that time  ? ... most of the stocks of the carabao mango became soft  and fully ripened in the warehouse while their skin were still green .Thou the superb taste  and aroma are still there  , they never sold and  sadly all the mangos ended up in the dumpster . The importer lost his shirt that day including his pants  and said never again for carabao mango.  So this is one of the reality of  handling and merchandising carabao mangos  post harvest and at point of destination .  It has nothing to do with management techniques like what you have mentioned.  (Also I don‚Äôt make negative comments without basis .)   Before Dr  Hernani Golez  our known mango expert died in 2009 , I had the chance to discuss with him  some of these issues I was sharing now to everyone , and at that time he was almost done with his new research on controlled atmosphere (CA) storage for our green carabao mangoes. ( With CA  technology  apples in the us can be stored for a year ). This  post harvest technology will prolonged shelf life of our mangoes  when transported over long distances using ocean vessels rather than the prohibitive  cost of air freight . From what he had  disclosed that time he was almost done with  his research , saying that our mangos may now be stored for a longer period of time (10 -14 days ) maintaining their green stage  and arriving at their destination ready to ripen.  So if this is the case now , we still need to find out the final landed cost for a piece of mango to its country of destination using this new technology.",Victor Chico,0

2201079273307863-99,False,2201079273307863-89,"Denden Galit  in us they tried selling it for 4 US dollar a piece. This was more than a decade ago. Nothing was heard about it since then .  At $ 20 a piece you can buy two boxes of  Ataulfo ( Manila mango)Kent , Keith and Haden mango originating from Mexico  and South America here in the us.  They are also sweet , aromatic , fiberless and would taste  the best for people who are used to these varieties. Kaiser and Alphonso from India are even more desirable for the Middle East market.   So  let‚Äôs see  what happens then with our $20 a piece mango .  Would surely love to hear your  feedback on the volume of sales.
