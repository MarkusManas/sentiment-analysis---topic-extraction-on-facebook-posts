2198363760246081,March 23 at 9:16 PM,MannyPi√±ol, Solar-Powered Irrigation System Which Critics Want to Discredit!  Politicians in my home province afflicted with crab mentality are trying to discredit me for the two units of Solar-Powered Irrigation Systems which faced technical challenges because these were among the first to be completed.  Unknown to them, over 160 other units have either been completed and operational or nearing completion in other parts of the country.  Here is one operating unit in Sibalom, Antique which is now helping the farmers.  Many more units will be built this year.  In fact, the Israelis are offering a P44-B fund to build 6,200 units all over the country to irrigate 500,000 hectares.  Other provinces are thankful to have the SPIS but the political officials of my own province who are threatened by the goodwill these projects would establish on the people are discrediting the SPIS.  Let me just make it clear by asking them this question:  Ayaw nyo ba talaga magkaroon ang taga North Cotabato ng Solar Powered Irrigation System?  Kung ayaw nyo na umunlad ang buhay ng mga magsasaka sa North Cotabato, desisyon nyo yan.  Lahat ng SPIS na naka earmark for North Cotabato, puede naman ilipat sa ibang probinsya.  #UnelievableCrabMentality! #DirtyPoliticsOfCotabato! #KahuloyaNgaBatasan!
