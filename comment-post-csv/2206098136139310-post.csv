2206098136139310,March 28 at 3:42 PM,MannyPiñol, 16 More Under Construction  CAGAYAN FARMERS RECEIVE SOLAR IRRIGATION PROJECT  By Manny Piñol  Farmers of Alcala town in Cagayan Province formally received from the Department of Agriculture yesterday a P5.64-M Solar Powered Irrigation System (SPIS) in formal turn over ceremonies.  (I was supposed to be present during the turn-over but the pilot of the helicopter which I used said that he could not fly at night and he had to be back in Manila by 6 p.m.)  The Solar-Powered Irrigation Sytem located at Barangay San Esteban, Alcala, Cagayan was turned over by SPIS Program Coordinator Claire Billones to Alcala City Mayor Criselda I. Antonio and the farmer recipients the San Esteban Small Water Irrigation System Association led by their President Alex A. Yere.  Construction of the Alcala SPIS in September 2018 was completed December 2018, making it the first Solar Irrigation Project completed in Region 2.  Before the completion of the SPIS  Brgy. Captain Francisco Verzola of San Esteban said farmers used diesel-powered pumps to irrigate their farm lands spending about  P20,000 per hectarr per cropping for diesel alone.   Upon the completion of the project in December, the farmers saved the money spent for diesel fuel.  They expect a better yield and are planning for a second cropping since water is readily available.   Brgy. Captain Verzola in 2017 sent a letter of request in the DA Regional Office II for Solar-powered Irrigation System.   Verzola said that he made the request after he heard me in one interview over DZRH that SPIS is one of the DA's priority projects.  He expressed his gratitude that the Department accommodated his request and the SPIS is now being used by his members.  A report submitted by Claire Billones said "the system is powered by a 22,400 watts Solar Arrays which drives the 25hp submersible pump that delivers 180m3/hr water output in 5-8 hrs."  "The water is distributed through a 450-M High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipes throughout the rice production area.  "The system is designed to irrigate 10 hectares of rainfed rice area but actual data show that the system now serves as much as 32 hectares," according to Billones.  Sixxteen (16) more units are being constructed and nearing completion across the Region.  #KungGustoMaramingParaan! #ReachingOutToFarmers! #DuterteDelivers!
