2198009370281520-6,False,0,"March 23, 2019        Marked red on our calendar the date wherein onion produce by Novo Ecijanos and other provinces has suffered much loss due to unfavorable price with the calvary on how and where to sell it.        ""Mabibili o mabubulok"", quoted is the sad truth that haunts our present onion farmers. Morons are those who did not know that onions are highly perishable if not handled or stored properly right after the harvest. Buyers are difficult to be found, as if there is a sort of STOP BUYING, which made it impossible for farmers to immediately dispose their harvest, unlike the previous years.       The markets were seemed closed for our local onion harvest.  Consequences are, the surge of agents which offers storage spaces to prolong the shelf life of the products, until the time wherein justifiable price per kilogram and availability of buyers insued. Storage are additional expenses on the part of the producers, and only few people can afford this option.       What are the leading causes of these phenomena?        This is not the first time that farmers suffer for not being able to earn enough income through their harvest. This law on supply and demand are not being used as a tool,  but as a reason to explain the cause of disappointments and hunger every year.       The near Senatorial elections had diverted the attention of current officials, as well as the public and private sectors, which had caused them to neglect the duties they held on their current positions.        Significantly, the Department of Agriculture which have the principal authority to provide efficient and immediate response, investigation and monitoring on the cause and effect of this problem had done nothing until now. Where should we ask for action? So slow.  DA's failure encourage people to abandon agriculture.       We want profit from our hard work. We work hard to live. We just want better lives.",Norina Lazaro Javier Lcb,0
