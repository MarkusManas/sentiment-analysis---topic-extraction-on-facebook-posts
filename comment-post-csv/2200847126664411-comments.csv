And there was hitch: the backyard cottage industry's workplaces were dingy, unsanitary, fly-infested, blah, blah. Environmental and handling qualities were just too poor and unacceptable to the Japanese. And so slowly the Japanese niche disappeared, the industry stagnated..

2200847126664411-7,False,0,"Philippine Government through PCA should invest in massive R&D so we could discover more products out of our coconut.

2200847126664411-15,False,0,"Sec Pinol, one very important input in the growing of coconut trees is salt. Saltmaking or salt production industry must be under DA because saltbeds are used in growing fish during the rainy season. Each coco tree needs about 4kg of salt every year to stay healthy and bear more fruits. Salt is used in livestock and poultry feeds.   Besides DOST which provides some R&D assistance, no government agency is really in charge of “salt”.   Just imagine the livelihood opportunities we can generate from saltmaking",Westly Rivera Rosario,0
