BELARUS OPENS MARKET  FOR PH AGRI PRODUCTS  By Manny Piñol  Minsk, Belarus - The Government of Belarus has asked the Philippine Department of Agriculture (DA) for list of agricultural products it would like to export to the East European country so that these could be given sanitary permits prior to the Philippine participation in the biggest Agricultural Expo in June this year.  Among the products to be showcased in the Bel-Agro Festival to be held in Minsk are Coconut, especially green young coconuts and coconut water, mango, banana, pineapple, canned tuna, bottled sardines and premium coffee and cacao.  Belarus Deputy Minister Ivan Smilhin said the Bel-Agro Festival is participated in by at least 20 Eastern European countries.  Smilhin said the Philippines will have to undertake a promotional campaign for its products, especially Coconut because it is a new commodity to the EEU consumers who have been using Sunflower and Olive Oil.  The Philippines started its aggressive marketing campaign in the 180-million population Eastern European Union on Friday with engagements with the Belarus Agriculture Ministry and officials of a leading supermarket chain in the country.  Led by the Department of Agriculture (DA) and supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) through Ambassador Carlos D. Sorreta and the Department of Trade and Industry, the mission aims to open up a new market for its coconut products, including mangoes, bananas, pineapple and fish.  Other members of the delegation include Philippine Rice Research Institute (PRRI) executive director Dr. Sailila Abdula who along with Planters' Products Inc. officials led by Engr. Rodel Manara are looking into fertiliser supplies and the CIIF-Oil Management Group headed by Benjamin Pineda.  In just one day, the delegation, headed by the Secretary of Agriculture, wrapped up three agreements, including its participation in the Bel-Agro, the entry of Belarus tractors into the country and the initial shipment of mango, canned pineapple, canned tuna and the display of coconut products in one of the stores of Euro-Opt, a leading supermarket chain in Belarus.  While Belarus only has a population of 10-million, it is considered the gateway to the rest of the Eastern European market.  The delegation arrived in Moscow after midnight Saturday and help a series of meetings with different companies interested in Philippine agricultural investments.  Today, the delegation will have a Bilateral Meeting with Russian Agriculture Ministry officials and the owner of Magnet, Russia's biggest supermarket chain.  #OfficialSalesmanOfDA! #TiyagaLangMayBungaMapipitas! #BukasMayUmagangDarating!
