CHALLENGE IN SELLING NEW PRODUCT IN 180-M EASTERN EUROPEAN MARKET  By Manny Piñol  Minsk, Belarus - There was a guttural murmuring among my Belarusian counterparts when I told them that my grandmother had long black hair because she used coconut oil as shampoo and that a special oil made from coconut, the MCT, is said to protect people from Alzheimer's.  The murmuring grew louder when I added that fresh coconut water is used as a dextrose substitute to rehydrate wounded soldiers in the battlefields and that it could also be used as battery solution.  I have to admit that it is really an uphill climb for the Philippines to convince Eastern European consumers to shift from Olive Oil and Sunflower Oil to Coconut Oil but I believe that in the one-day series of engagements in Minsk last Friday, including an introductory sales meeting with the biggest supermarket chain officers, the Belarusians are now interested to know more about coconut.   "You are selling a totally new product," Belarus Deputy Agricultural Minister Ivan Shiltin told me during our Bilateral Meeting Friday morning.  He suggested that a more aggressive marketing effort be initiated by the Philippine Government to convince Eastern European consumers on the health benefits of Coconut and its many products, including coconut sugar, syrup, flour and virgin oil.  The Department of Agriculture (DA), with the support of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Trade and Industry, is taking up the challenge.  On June 4 to 9, the Philippines will join over 20 other countries in the Bel-Agro Festival where the best agricultural and fisheries products from the country will be displayed.  Coconut products, including Green Coconuts which will be shipped three weeks before the event, will be the main feature of the Philippine participation.  The Belarusians, however, will also be introduced to fresh Tuna which will be shipped by air, canned and bottled sardines, dried fish, bananas, pineapple, coffee and cacao, the finest abaca handicrafts and other products.  This will be the biggest participation by the Philippines in an Eastern European Agricultural Expo since President Rody Duterte started engaging with Russia and the other countries of the former Soviet Union.  In addition to the participation in Agricultural Expos, the DA will also engage local TV shows in presenting to Eastern European consumers the health benefits of Coconut and the other Philippine products.  In fact, a famous Russian TV show is now being targeted as a possible partner of the DA in the promotion of Philippine products.  Already, the Euro-Opt, Belarus' biggest second biggest supermarket chain, has agreed to open a display area for Philippine products before and after the Bel-Agro Expo in June.  They have also placed an initial order for Philippine mangoes, canned Tuna and bottled sardines.  It is hoped that in the months to come, the guttural murmurings of the Belarusians will turn into a boisterous demand for more products from the Philippines.  #BukasMayUmagangDarating! #KungMayTiyagaMayNilaga! #SalesmanModeMunaTayo!
