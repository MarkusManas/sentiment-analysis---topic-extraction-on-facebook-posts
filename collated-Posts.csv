2196073673808423,March 22 at 8:17 AM,MannyPiñol," Dumping of palm oil feared!   DA RENEWS CALL FOR PALM OIL IMPORT BAN  By Manny Piñol  The Department of Agriculture has renewed its earlier recommendation for a ""temporary ban"" on palm oil imports as Filipino coconut and oil palm farmers complain of extremely low prices due to the dumping of the commodity by two major palm oil producing countries in Southeast Asia.  Palm Oil imports from Indonesia and Malaysia have increased by 900% over the last three years.  The DA also asked the Department of Energy and the National Bio-Fuels Board to increase the coconut oil component of the bio-diesel from B2 to B5", or from 2% to 5%.  The two recommendations which were made as early as last year were resubmitted by the DA to the Economic Cluster,  the DOE and NBB following reports that the European Union has started the ban on palm oil imports from Malaysia and Indonesia over environmental issues.  This development is expected to result in the dumping of palm oil into countries like the Philippines.  Under the rules of the World Trade Organization, member countries could initiate measures to safeguard its farmers affected by the dumping of excess commodities from other countries.  The ban is temporary and is effective only for a specified period.  The increase in the coconut oil composition of the bio-diesel to 5% is projected to consume about 200,000-metric tons of copra.  Coconut oil in bio-diesel also reduces air pollution and increases mileage by at least 3 kilometers per liter.  This recommendation, however, is opposed by major fuel companies saying that it would increase diesel fuel cost by P0. 35 per liter.  Pending action on these recommendations, the DA through the Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC) has offered loans for livelihood projects for coconut farmers.  The DA has also offered loans for the acquisition of hauling trucks and working capital for farmers groups so they could buy the product of their members and deliver these directly to the coconut oil mills.  On Tuesday, the government owned CIIF-Oil Management Group has agreed to set its mill gate buying price at P20 per kilo.  #SanaTulunganAngMagniniyog!

2196129020469555,March 22 at 9:19 AM,MannyPiñol, Onion cartel at work!  DA SEEKS PCC, NBI HELP VERSUS TRADING FIRMS  By Manny Piñol  The Department of Agriculture (DA) has asked the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate and conduct raids of cold storage facilities leased and closed down by big trading firms to force farmers to sell at low prices.  On Wednesday, I sent two official communications to PCC Executive Director Kenneth Tanate and NBI Director Dante Gierran asking the two agencies to take action against owners of cold storage facilities who have connived with onion traders by refusing to take in farmers Onion produce.  By preventing farmers from storing their produce in the cold storage facilities, the traders expect farmers to sell at low prices.  Prices of red onion fell from a high of P30 before harvest to only about P15 now.   Among the companies targeted for investigation for possible violation of Fair Competition and Economic Sabotage are Rivson, Argo, Kasamne and Titan, all in Nueva Ecija.   With bumper harvest of Onion now in Central Luzon, Mindoro and Iloilo, traders have started their manipulation of the market.   The practice in the Onion Industry is for local farmers to store their excess production in cold storage facilities and release this to the market at off-season.  Some of these storage facilities were built with government funds and turned over to Farmers Cooperatives some of which connive with big time traders now.   The DA is funding the construction of three more cold storage facilities this year in Tarlac, Mindoro and Iloilo.  DA Undersecretary for Operations Ariel Cayanan and the Agricultural Credit Policy Council Executive Director Jocelyn Badiola have been ordered to help onion farmers pending results of the investigation.  The ACPC was directed to extend working capital loans so that Onion Farmers could buy the produce of their members.  Usec Cayanan was directed to engage other private cold storage facilities for temporary use by onion farmers.  #TamaNaAngPanlalamang! #PatasNaLabanLang!

2196167813799009,March 22 at 9:58 AM,MannyPiñol, New DA directive   NO ONION IMPORTATION PENDING CARTEL PROBE  By Manny Piñol  The Department of Agriculture (DA) will suspend the importation of Bulb Onions pending the results of the investigation of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) and the National Bureau of Investigation into the reported operations of a cartel manipulating the buying price of locally-produced Onion.   This would prevent the cartel from benefitting from their operations where they forced the drop in the buying price of local onions by leasing and closing cold storage facilities tp onion farmers.  The DA on Wednesday asked the PCC and NBI to investigate reports that trading firms have closed down four major cold storage facilities in an apparent attempt to force farmers to sell at low prices.  The traders are expected to consolidate the local production as they await for the time when they will be allowed to import.  With the farmers' produce bought at very low prices cornered and consolidated, traders could control the pricing of Onion in the market and generate huge profits.  Under an arrangement agreed between farmers groups and the importers, the importation of Onions would only be done after the harvest of the local onions.  The DA has directed the Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) to support the arrangement by scheduling the processing of Sanitary and Pytho-Sanitary permits until after the harvest season.  The BPI has reported that no SPS permits have been issued since October.  The moratorium on the issuance of SPS permits will be extended until such time the PCC and NBI have terminated their investigation.  All agencies under the DA are notified to implement this directive.  #UCantEatUrOwnCake! #TamaNaAngPananamantala!

DA GIVES FARMERS FUNDS TO BUY ONION PRODUCTION  By Manny Piñol  The Department of Agriculture (DA) will provide Onion Farmers Associations with working capital to be used in buying their members' produce to protect them the price manipulation by traders.  The DA Secretary has also ordered Director Roy Abaya of DA Field Operations to source reefer vans which could be used as temporary storage facilities for the farmers Onion production.  These twin moves were in response to the recommendations made by Task Force Allium to neutralize the manipulation by traders of the Onion pricing as harvest comes into full swing.  Just like in its program to support coconut farmers facing low prices of Copra, the DA will provide an initial working capital of P200-M through the Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC).  The working capital could be used in buying the farmers Onion production which could be kept in reefer vans to be released to the market when prices have stabilized.  The Working Capital could be released as soon as the farmers groups have bern validated and provided with reefer vans.   Earlier, the DA asked the Philippine Competition Commission and the National Bureau of Investigation to probe reports that at least four cold storage facilities have been leased in advance by traders and closed to force farmers to sell at low prices.  The DA has also ordered that there will be no importation permits issued until after the investigation on alleged manipulation by traders.  #TamaNaAngPagsasamantala!

2198363760246081,March 23 at 9:16 PM,MannyPiñol, Solar-Powered Irrigation System Which Critics Want to Discredit!  Politicians in my home province afflicted with crab mentality are trying to discredit me for the two units of Solar-Powered Irrigation Systems which faced technical challenges because these were among the first to be completed.  Unknown to them, over 160 other units have either been completed and operational or nearing completion in other parts of the country.  Here is one operating unit in Sibalom, Antique which is now helping the farmers.  Many more units will be built this year.  In fact, the Israelis are offering a P44-B fund to build 6,200 units all over the country to irrigate 500,000 hectares.  Other provinces are thankful to have the SPIS but the political officials of my own province who are threatened by the goodwill these projects would establish on the people are discrediting the SPIS.  Let me just make it clear by asking them this question:  Ayaw nyo ba talaga magkaroon ang taga North Cotabato ng Solar Powered Irrigation System?  Kung ayaw nyo na umunlad ang buhay ng mga magsasaka sa North Cotabato, desisyon nyo yan.  Lahat ng SPIS na naka earmark for North Cotabato, puede naman ilipat sa ibang probinsya.  #UnelievableCrabMentality! #DirtyPoliticsOfCotabato! #KahuloyaNgaBatasan!
2198465990235858,March 23 at 10:38 PM,MannyPiñol, Solar-Powered Irrigation  ISRAELI EXPERTS ESTABLISH SPIS AS GIFTS TO FARMERS  By Manny Piñol  Israeli Solar-Powered Irrigation experts will establish two units in Lumban, Laguna as their gifts to Filipino farmers while they will collaborate with three local companies to build three more all over the country.  All the SPIS units will use modern Israeli technology for Solar-Powered Irrigation Systems, a new program adopted by the Department of Agriculture.  The LR Group, one of the biggest agro-industrial companies of Israel, has offered a P44-B loan to establish 6,200 units of Solar-Powered Irrigation Systems to serve 500,000 hectares of farms all over the country.  To show their interest, the LR Group offered to showcase modern Israeli technology in Solar Irrigation by building and donating two units.  The LR Group, represented by Doron Retter together with the Regional Agricultural Engineering Department of Region IV-A CALABARZON, conducted detailed topographic survey of the sites feasible for SPIS in Lumban last week.   Two sites were identified in Lumban, Laguna, an open source(Lumban River) designed for 10ha service area and a Shallow Tube Well (STW) powered by diesel pump covering 3 ha of service area to be converted to Solar-Powered  Pump.  In six weeks, the prototype now being assembled in Israelwill be available for testing and will be shipped here in the Philippines for installation.  Last Wednesday, the High-Level Meeting on Water attended by agencies of government endorsed the Solar-Powered Irrigation System to protect farmers from the adverse effects of droughts and El Niño.  #AyawItoNgPolitikoNgCotabato! #IsraelADesertRemember!

2199189190163538,March 24 at 9:59 AM,MannyPiñol, A fair warning!  POOR WATER MANAGEMENT COULD LEAD TO AGRI CRISIS  By Manny Piñol  In the High Level Meeting of Cabinet Secretaries on Water, I made a presentation which emphasized the threat of a looming water crisis, especially for Agriculture, if we do not act now.  There are three key elements in Agricultural Productivity - Land, Sunlight and Water.  Land and sunlight could be substituted with aquaponics technology and artificial light but there could never be Agriculture without Water.  Water Supply for Agriculture in the Philippines has been declining over the last few decades because of several major reasons:  1. Continued deforestation threatening the headwaters of major river systems in the country;  2. Frequency in the occurrence of “El Niño” which now hits the country after every two years;  3. Delay in the implementation of irrigation systems;  4. Absence of water conservation programs and water catchments and small impounding dams;  5. Reliance of Agriculture on traditional irrigation systems instead of embracing modern irrigation technology using Solar-Power.  Here are the long term recommendations of the Department of Agriculture submitted during the High Level Meeting on Water presided by Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and attended by Cabinet Secretaries and heads of government agencies last Wednesday:  1. A national program to locate and identify headwaters which would be declared as  protected areas;  2. Stricter enforcement of forest protection laws;  3. Dredging of major river systems to increase water holding capacity and prevent flooding during rainy season;  4. Passage of a law on National Soil and Water Conservation Program and giving the DA the mandate and funding to build small reservoirs, impounding and water catchments all over the country. (Please refer to pending bill by sen. Loren Legarda. 1621313441!.pdf)   5. Funding and implementation of alternative irrigation systems specifically the Solar-Powered irrigation Systems.  Unless these measures are implemented, the Philippines could face a major water crisis in the next few years.  #IgnoringGodsBlessings! #EfficientWaterManagement!

2199239470158510,March 24 at 10:51 AM,MannyPiñol, Sila araw-araw may El Nino!  ISRAEL, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, PERU GROW CROPS SANS RAIN  By Manny Piñol  As the country goes through another dry spell after a two-year interval, I have been asked several times how do we  prepare for and neutralise the damage caused by a long dry spell or El Nino?  Just like the typhoons which ravage the country every year, there is really nothing much that could be done to stop El Nino except mitigate the damage and provide interventions like crop insurance afterwards.  It is just like watching an egg roll from a table and fall to splatter on the floor.  All that you can do is just clean up the mess.  This has been our mindset in handling droughts and long dry spells - sit it out and pick up the shattered pieces after the calamity.  This is so reflective of our laid back nature and culture as a people who take and bear whatever destructive power Mother Nature dishes out and leave our fate to the Mercy of God.   There is actually a more effective strategy in preparing for El Nino and we only need to learn lessons from countries who do farming in desert areas without any rainfall all year round  Desert areas like Israel, Southern California, Peru and parts of India go through year-long droughts making our 3 to 4-month El Nino just a minor distraction.  Unlike us in the Philippines who have ignored and squandered the Water which God gives us every year, however, these countries have efficiently managed whatever water they have, including wastewater.   So how do we prepare for El Nino?  My stock answer has always been: Irrigate.  That may sound paradoxical because how do you irrigate where there is a drought?  Again," my answer is: Emulate the Kung Fu Masters by using the strength of the ""enemy"" to overpower him.  This is what Israel", Southern California, Peru and other desert countries have been doing.   This is precisely the philosophy behind the adoption by the Department of Agriculture of the Solar-Powered Irrigation System or SPIS.  The idea of embracing Solar-Powered Irrigation for Philippine Agriculture came to my mind when I was in Aparri, Cagayan in May of 2016, shortly before I assumed office as Secretary of Agriculture.  Beside the parched rice fields was the mighty Cagayan River but whose water could not be used to irrigate the farms because the banks were so high.  That was when I remembered what I saw in the Tilapia Farm of my friend, Rocky French in the middle of the desert in Coachella Valley, Southern California.  Using hundreds of solar panels to run three water pumps, Rocky drew water from underground to fill up his ponds and raise world-class quality Tilapia.  In the same area, vegetable plantations growing Bell Peppers and others and vine yards were thriving in spite of the fact that there would only be about four rains a year.  The area virtually has El Niño or drought all year round but the farmers do not complain of crop damage or inability to plant.  The reason is simple: they use the power of the Sun, which causes the drought, to power Solar Pumps to produce water.  Also, the sustained and sufficient sunlight promotes effective photosynthesis thus resulting in greater productivity.  The El Niño or drought has been occurring with greater frequency over the last two decades, hitting our farms every two years now.  Unless we decide to invest in Solar-Powered Irrigation and implement it nationwide, our farmers will always suffer every time El Niño hits the country.  Not even an agriculture expert with several Phd's could stop that or ease the suffering of our farmers.  I made this call as early as 2016 but mine was a voice in the wilderness.  In fact, one economic mind said that he does not see the correlation between Solar-Powered Irrigation and greater productivity.  With the El Niño hitting us again now and farmers crops getting devastated," we see the clear correlation.  We have to change our ""Post-Disaster Intervention"" mindset now or else we will regret it.  Let this be a fair warning to our policy makers and budget managers.   #LandSunlightWater! #FoodGrowsWhereWaterFlows! #LetsIrrigateNow!

2200847126664411,March 25 at 11:10 AM,MannyPiñol, Coconut, mango, bananas, fish!  BELARUS OPENS MARKET  FOR PH AGRI PRODUCTS  By Manny Piñol  Minsk, Belarus - The Government of Belarus has asked the Philippine Department of Agriculture (DA) for list of agricultural products it would like to export to the East European country so that these could be given sanitary permits prior to the Philippine participation in the biggest Agricultural Expo in June this year.  Among the products to be showcased in the Bel-Agro Festival to be held in Minsk are Coconut, especially green young coconuts and coconut water, mango, banana, pineapple, canned tuna, bottled sardines and premium coffee and cacao.  Belarus Deputy Minister Ivan Smilhin said the Bel-Agro Festival is participated in by at least 20 Eastern European countries.  Smilhin said the Philippines will have to undertake a promotional campaign for its products, especially Coconut because it is a new commodity to the EEU consumers who have been using Sunflower and Olive Oil.  The Philippines started its aggressive marketing campaign in the 180-million population Eastern European Union on Friday with engagements with the Belarus Agriculture Ministry and officials of a leading supermarket chain in the country.  Led by the Department of Agriculture (DA) and supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) through Ambassador Carlos D. Sorreta and the Department of Trade and Industry, the mission aims to open up a new market for its coconut products, including mangoes, bananas, pineapple and fish.  Other members of the delegation include Philippine Rice Research Institute (PRRI) executive director Dr. Sailila Abdula who along with Planters' Products Inc. officials led by Engr. Rodel Manara are looking into fertiliser supplies and the CIIF-Oil Management Group headed by Benjamin Pineda.  In just one day, the delegation, headed by the Secretary of Agriculture, wrapped up three agreements, including its participation in the Bel-Agro, the entry of Belarus tractors into the country and the initial shipment of mango, canned pineapple, canned tuna and the display of coconut products in one of the stores of Euro-Opt, a leading supermarket chain in Belarus.  While Belarus only has a population of 10-million, it is considered the gateway to the rest of the Eastern European market.  The delegation arrived in Moscow after midnight Saturday and help a series of meetings with different companies interested in Philippine agricultural investments.  Today, the delegation will have a Bilateral Meeting with Russian Agriculture Ministry officials and the owner of Magnet, Russia's biggest supermarket chain.  #OfficialSalesmanOfDA! #TiyagaLangMayBungaMapipitas! #BukasMayUmagangDarating!

2200936136655510,March 25 at 12:13 PM,MannyPiñol, Assured No Corruption!  ICONIC BELARUS TRACTOR EYES PH ASSEMBLY PLANT  Minsk, Belarus - The giant Minsk Tractor Works, makers of the iconic Belarus farm tractor, has decided to enter the Philippine market and establish an assembly plant following assurances by the Department of Agriculture that the administration of President Rody Duterte ensures ease of doing business without corruption.  The Belarus is one of the most popular Eastern European farm tractors which has sold almost 3-million units all over the world since the establishment of the factory before World War II.  It has not penetrated the Philippine market in spite of previous attempts, however, because of the tedious government procurement process in the past, according to Alexandre Badytchyk, deputy head of the commercial department of the commercial department.  Assured that the Duterte Administration has initiated a campaign to check corruption in government, especially in the procurement of equipment, machinery and supplies, Minsk Tractor Works officials said they will immediately send a delegation to the Philippines to scout for possible local distributors.  They said that they will consider the establishment of an assembly plant in the Philippines, just like what the company did in Cambodia.  The Minsk Tractor Works said opening up an assembly plant could make the company more competitive in the sale of their farm tractors.  It could also provide employment to Filipino engineers and skilled workers.  The Minsk Tractor Works, whose main manufacturing plant is in a 150-hectare area in the heart of Minsk, employs over 30,000 people.  The company manufactures garden tractors with 15 horsepower to the giant tractors that they export to the rest of Europe and Africa.  #EmploymentOpportunitiesOpened! #ForeignDirectInvestments!

2201010166648107,March 25 at 1:06 PM,MannyPiñol, Using coconut to sell coconut!  CHALLENGE IN SELLING NEW PRODUCT IN 180-M EASTERN EUROPEAN MARKET  By Manny Piñol  Minsk, Belarus - There was a guttural murmuring among my Belarusian counterparts when I told them that my grandmother had long black hair because she used coconut oil as shampoo and that a special oil made from coconut, the MCT, is said to protect people from Alzheimer's.  The murmuring grew louder when I added that fresh coconut water is used as a dextrose substitute to rehydrate wounded soldiers in the battlefields and that it could also be used as battery solution.  I have to admit that it is really an uphill climb for the Philippines to convince Eastern European consumers to shift from Olive Oil and Sunflower Oil to Coconut Oil but I believe that in the one-day series of engagements in Minsk last Friday, including an introductory sales meeting with the biggest supermarket chain officers," the Belarusians are now interested to know more about coconut.   ""You are selling a totally new product"," Belarus Deputy Agricultural Minister Ivan Shiltin told me during our Bilateral Meeting Friday morning.  He suggested that a more aggressive marketing effort be initiated by the Philippine Government to convince Eastern European consumers on the health benefits of Coconut and its many products, including coconut sugar, syrup, flour and virgin oil.  The Department of Agriculture (DA), with the support of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Trade and Industry, is taking up the challenge.  On June 4 to 9, the Philippines will join over 20 other countries in the Bel-Agro Festival where the best agricultural and fisheries products from the country will be displayed.  Coconut products, including Green Coconuts which will be shipped three weeks before the event, will be the main feature of the Philippine participation.  The Belarusians, however, will also be introduced to fresh Tuna which will be shipped by air, canned and bottled sardines, dried fish, bananas, pineapple, coffee and cacao, the finest abaca handicrafts and other products.  This will be the biggest participation by the Philippines in an Eastern European Agricultural Expo since President Rody Duterte started engaging with Russia and the other countries of the former Soviet Union.  In addition to the participation in Agricultural Expos, the DA will also engage local TV shows in presenting to Eastern European consumers the health benefits of Coconut and the other Philippine products.  In fact, a famous Russian TV show is now being targeted as a possible partner of the DA in the promotion of Philippine products.  Already, the Euro-Opt, Belarus' biggest second biggest supermarket chain, has agreed to open a display area for Philippine products before and after the Bel-Agro Expo in June.  They have also placed an initial order for Philippine mangoes, canned Tuna and bottled sardines.  It is hoped that in the months to come, the guttural murmurings of the Belarusians will turn into a boisterous demand for more products from the Philippines.  #BukasMayUmagangDarating! #KungMayTiyagaMayNilaga! #SalesmanModeMunaTayo!

2201079273307863,March 25 at 2:04 PM,MannyPiñol, OMG, Isang piraso, P1,000!  EASTERN EUROPE AWAITS SWEET PHILIPPINE MANGO  By Manny Piñol  Moscow, Russia - Eastern Europe is eagerly awaiting the first shipment of mangoes from the Philippines, especially the world famous and iconic Guimaras Mango.  Philippine Ambassador to the Russian Federation Carlos D. Sorreta said that he has been working on the shipment of mangoes to Russia for the last two years only to be told that there is not enough supply of the Guimaras variety.  On Saturday, shortly after I learned of the demand, I immediately called up Agriculture Region VI Director Remelyn Recoter to engage mango farmers of Guimaras through Board Member Dan Elby Habaña and determine whether there is available supply.  I was informed that harvest has already started and that an initial shipment could be made by the first week of April.  The Department of Agriculture (DA) intends to market Philippine mangoes according to variety with the Guimaras as the premium mango.  Those from Zambales and Pangasinan will also be labeled according to the name of the provinces while those from Cebu, Iloilo, Davao and Cotabato will also carry the name of the provinces.  Today, I will meet with the biggest importer of fresh fruits from Asia and will discuss the details of the first shipment of Philippine mangoes to Russia.  Yesterday, Sunday, Ambassador Sorrete invited the Philippine delegation to lunch in a corner eatery owned by Filipino Michael Angara in a supermarket in Moscow.  Ambassador Sorreta led me to a stall which sold mangoes from Thailand, India and Pakistan.  I was shocked to discover that a huge piece of mango which is not even half as sweet as the Philippine mango was sold for P1,"000.  The entry of the sweet Philippine mango into the Russian and Belarusian markets could radically change the preference of consumers in Eastern Europe.  Philippine Honorary Consul to Belarus Viktor Chevstov who tasted a few pieces of Guimaras mango which the delegation brought in Friday said that Philippine mango is far superior that any other variety he has tasted.  ""After having Guimaras mango", I won't eat any other mango," he said during dinner he tendered for the Philippine delegation.  #ExploringNewMarkets! #AngDamiPuedengMabenta! #DBestTalagaAngMangaPilipino!

2204010499681407,March 27 at 8:34 AM,MannyPiñol, $5-B food market  PH JOINS AGRI EXPOS IN BELARUS, RUSSIA  Moscow, Russia - The Philippines launches its aggressive marketing campaign for its agricultural products in Eastern Europe with its participation in two major Agri Expos in Belarus and Russia this year.  The aggressive campaign is aimed at taking a bite of the previously unexplored market of 180-million people which was opened only following the visit by President Rody Duterte to Moscow in May 2017.  In two bilateral meetings with officials of the Agriculture Ministry of Belarus and the Russian Federation over the weekend, the Department of Agriculture also signed implementing agreements aimed at strengthening its agricultural trade with the two countries.  The first event which will be participated in by the Philippines will be the Belarus Agro Expo or Bel-Agro which is traditionally participated in over 20 Eastern European countries.  Set up in a 25-hectare complex, Bel-Agro is considered as one of the biggest Agricultural Expos in Eastern Europe.  In September, the Philippines will field a huge delegation of its agricultural producers to the World Food Expo of Moscow.  The Department of Agriculture is supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs through its Embassy in the Russian Federation and the Department of Trade and Industry through its commercial attache based in Moscow.  Among the products lined up for presentation are:  - Coconut Oil-based products, including Coco Sugar, Coco Syrup, Virgin Coconut Oil, Desiccated Coconut, Activated Carbon and Green Coconuts;  - Banana, including other banana-based products such as Banana Catsup and Banana Flour;  - Mango, Pineapple and other tropical fruits;  - Cacao and Coffee beans and other processed products;  - Fisheries products, including canned Tuna, bottled sardines, dried fish, carrageenan, shrimps and others.  Philippine Ambassador to the Russian Federation, including Belarus, Carlos D. Sorreta, is now laying the ground works for the Philippine participation in the two major food expos.  Prior to its participation in the major food expos, the DA will launch a massive information and media campaign to present the products from the Philippines.  Television shows featuring food and other agricultural products will be tapped in introducing the new products, especially coconut.  #MarketingCompletesAgriProcess! #KungMayTiyagaMayNilaga! #BukasMayUmagangDarating!

2205274549555002,March 28 at 3:23 AM,MannyPiñol, Happy Birthday PRRD!  DA COMMISSIONS SIGNAL 5 TYPHOON-RESISTANT DOME  By Manny Piñol  Iguig, Cagayan - The days when government spends hundreds of millions of pesos to repair buildings and warehouses after the devastation by typhoons will soon be over.  The Department of Agriculture (DA) yesterday inaugurated and commissioned the first monolithic dome which will serve as a grains warehouse in the DA Experimental Station in Iguig town Cagayan Province.  Designed by German engineers, the first monolithic dome constructed by a Filipino company with Polish engineers as consultants could withstand Typhoon Signal 5 many of which previously devastated many DA buildings and warehouses in the Cagayan Valley Region.  I flew to Cagayan Province  yesterday shortly after arriving from a 4-day marketing promotions trip to Belarus and Russia over the weekend to commission the first-ever monolithic dome constructed by the DA.  Costing P10-M and constructed in record time, the monolithic dome is impressive indeed.  While the temperature outside when I arrived at 3:30 p.m. was a scorching 36C degrees, it was only 21C  inside the Monolithic Dome.  The Polish engineers told me that the dome has insulators which deflects the heat of the sun and keeps the interior temperature at levels ideal for grains storage.  DA Cagayan Valley Director Narciso Edillo said the Iguig Monolithic Dome is the first of 8 units to be established in the region which is hit by as much as 12 typhoons every year.   Seven other smaller units costing P5-M each are now being constructed for farmers' groups in Cagayan Valley Region.  When the Monolithic Domes are tested and proven to withstand the destructive power of typhoons, similar structures will be built in other areas located on the path of typhoons.  These areas include Eastern and Western Visayas, Bicol, Southern Tagalog including Mindoro, Central Luzon, Ilocos and Cordillera Regions.  Yesterday during the commissioning, I said it was our fitting birthday gift to President Rody Duterte to support his goal of making life better for the people.  This innovation, along with the National Color-Coded Agriculture Guide Map, the Solar-Powered Irrigation and many more, will make Philippine Agriculture Climate Change Resilient.  #NeverStopDreaming! #NeverStopBelieving! #KungGustoMaramingParaan! #BukasMayUmagangDarating!

2205352789547178,March 28 at 4:23 AM,MannyPiñol, Oversupply, smuggling  PH, INDO, MALAYSIA AGREE TO SETTLE PALM OIL ISSUE  By Manny Piñol  The Philippine Department of Agriculture and its ASEAN-neighbors Malaysia and Indonesia yesterday agreed to form a Tri-Partite Technical Working to address the smuggling dumping of Palm Oil into the Philippines hurting Coconut farmers.  The agreement was reached yesterday following a call by Malaysian and Indonesian government representatives on the Philippine Secretary of Agriculture.  The DA had earlier recommended a temporary ban on Palm Oil importation from Indonesia and Malaysia citing figures whicj indicate dumping of the commodity which led to the collapse of local coconut prices.  Importation data gathered by the DA showed that exports of Palm Oil to the Philippines by both Indonesia and Malaysia have increased by 100% over the last three years.  Since Palm Oil is cheaper than coconut oil, the increase in Palm Oil exports was cited one of  the reasons behind the collapse of copra prices.  During yesyerday's meeting, it wad agreed that the Technical Working Group will draft recommendations on the rationalization of Palm Oil exports to the Philippines.  The DA Secretary suggested the following:  1. Keeping Palm Oil exports by Malaysia and Indonesia at levels which would not hurt the Philippine Coconut and local Oil Palm Industry;  2. For Malaysia and Indonesia  to check on reports of the smuggling of Crude and Refined Palm Oil to the Philippines;  3. For Malaysia and Indonesia to open up their markets to Philippine products, especially coconut based products, to correct the trade imbalance.  The TWG is expected to be organized next week.  #DapatPatasAngLaban! #YouSellToUsWeSellToYou!  (Photos by Larry Nuestro DA-AFID)
2206098136139310,March 28 at 3:42 PM,MannyPiñol, 16 More Under Construction  CAGAYAN FARMERS RECEIVE SOLAR IRRIGATION PROJECT  By Manny Piñol  Farmers of Alcala town in Cagayan Province formally received from the Department of Agriculture yesterday a P5.64-M Solar Powered Irrigation System (SPIS) in formal turn over ceremonies.  (I was supposed to be present during the turn-over but the pilot of the helicopter which I used said that he could not fly at night and he had to be back in Manila by 6 p.m.)  The Solar-Powered Irrigation Sytem located at Barangay San Esteban, Alcala, Cagayan was turned over by SPIS Program Coordinator Claire Billones to Alcala City Mayor Criselda I. Antonio and the farmer recipients the San Esteban Small Water Irrigation System Association led by their President Alex A. Yere.  Construction of the Alcala SPIS in September 2018 was completed December 2018, making it the first Solar Irrigation Project completed in Region 2.  Before the completion of the SPIS  Brgy. Captain Francisco Verzola of San Esteban said farmers used diesel-powered pumps to irrigate their farm lands spending about  P20,000 per hectarr per cropping for diesel alone.   Upon the completion of the project in December," the farmers saved the money spent for diesel fuel.  They expect a better yield and are planning for a second cropping since water is readily available.   Brgy. Captain Verzola in 2017 sent a letter of request in the DA Regional Office II for Solar-powered Irrigation System.   Verzola said that he made the request after he heard me in one interview over DZRH that SPIS is one of the DA's priority projects.  He expressed his gratitude that the Department accommodated his request and the SPIS is now being used by his members.  A report submitted by Claire Billones said ""the system is powered by a 22","400 watts Solar Arrays which drives the 25hp submersible pump that delivers 180m3/hr water output in 5-8 hrs.""  ""The water is distributed through a 450-M High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipes throughout the rice production area.  ""The system is designed to irrigate 10 hectares of rainfed rice area but actual data show that the system now serves as much as 32 hectares"," according to Billones.  Sixxteen (16) more units are being constructed and nearing completion across the Region.  #KungGustoMaramingParaan! #ReachingOutToFarmers! #DuterteDelivers!

2207565115992612,March 29 at 05:12 AM,MannyPiñol, PCC INVESTIGATES ALLEGED  ONION COLD STORAGE CARTEL  The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) confirms the receipt of the request for assistance by the Department of Agriculture (DA) on the alleged cold storage cartel in the onion industry.  All of PCC’s actions are directed by its mandate to promote fair market competition, advance consumer welfare, and penalize violators of the Philippine Competition Act. As such, the antitrust authority reminds firms that the competition law punishes those engaged in cartels with a fine of P100 to P250 million, and imprisonment of up to seven (7) years.  Cold storage facilities form an important part in the value chain to prolong the shelf life of onions after harvest season. Proper storage allows its sale for an extended period or during lean months. PCC will look at the alleged refusal of storage access to onion farmers in favor of large traders and will also evaluate if there are business agreements that are anticompetitive or enablers of cartelistic behavior.  Specifically, PCC will examine whether there are competition concerns in the onion industry such as restriction of storage space or price manipulation by cartels, or whether the storage concerns are natural consequences of supply conditions.  Regulatory measures involving the importation of agricultural products are within DA’s jurisdiction, separate from PCC’s exercise of its mandate. The timing of any investigation or advisory from another agency like PCC should not prevent DA from exercising its own judgment in suspending or allowing importation.  With this, PCC welcomes the prospect of forging a Memorandum of Agreement with DA to harmonize the objectives of both agencies of fostering fair market competition and promoting agricultural growth. This cooperation is especially important in the face of the changes in the economic landscape of agricultural production and trade. Given the crucial importance of food and agriculture in the economy, particularly on the poor, PCC will assert all its powers as provided for in the competition law.  (This is the statement of the Philippine Competition Commission following receipt of a letter from the Department of Agriculture asking for an investigation on the alleged operation of groups monopolizing cold storage facilities.)
