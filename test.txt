pos - MannyPiñol  sir its true it's not easy to export meat to germany or Europe. . But i notice a new trend in  Europe or germany  itself , people are very conscious of healthy living.a lot cut their consumption of meat, I'm one of them too. A lot of vegan products are now sold ... And i found something that might be interesting to Philippine farmers. Jackfruit unripe in chunks are being sold here for vegans .. the store where i bought it is a chain huge company in whole Germany. I myself stirfry it with tofu..and spices.. Really very delicious. THe thing is i remember that in phil.we have also breadfruit...which for sure also when unriped can be used as meat substitute.   If only i could post foto here ,cause i took picture of it to show you sir @Manny Piñiol

pos - It is interesting to know that it was made possible by a Filipino journalist. Wow!Filipinos are now helping the government despite the active movement of destabilizers and disruptors. But they will not prevail. Hangga't may MannyPiñol sa DA, who is selflessly and whole-heartedly serving the country, mas lalong tumitibay ang pundasyon. It's another achievement on the part of Dept. of Agriculture. Farmers are now a lot happier. Buhayin ang agrikultura sa bansa! Go Piñol! Go DA! 💪👍👏👊

Powdered onions? How can we create new products that will cut perishability issue, stop cold storage costs, allow cheaper transport and sell at our local sarisari or 7-11 stores for the masses?
