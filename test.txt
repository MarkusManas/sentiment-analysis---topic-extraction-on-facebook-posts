pos - This is a good prospect. If Belarus will establish an assembly plant, at least the parts that will come into the country will not be taxed high as compared when the equipment is fully assembled. It will generate employment, and some of the parts can be manufactured locally, which may generate more businesses.
pos - JulCes Tajale correct talaga, tires for tractors like these can be made by the newly formed tire company featured recently, for example
pos - Yan ang sinasabi ko. Better train our local engineers To assemble farm implements. We have inventors in the  Philippines. Give incentives by launching a contest in coming up with innovative ideas.
pos - Salute!! To the hardworking, sincere, knowledegable public servant. God bless and more power sir
pos - Sec. Manny, Congratulations, good job. Let's not waste time to welcome this company and ask DTI to organize a  Team to facilitate the issuance of necessary permits and licenses.
pos - congrats sir
pos - I remember one time..nag invite si sec pinolwhenbhe was still governor of cotabato ng mga investor na Korean( if I'm not mistaken)..na maglagay ng assembly plant ng sprayer, mini tractors, or farm equipment and was displayed at kidapawan city gym...ngayon may in invite na nmn cya..good work Mr.secretary..if ma set up yan..another work opportunity yan sa mga kababayan natin...
pos - Good job sir... God sent u for the PHILIPPINE people..!  Magkano kaya mga price nyan sir nawa mapublish ang prices nyan.. pra sa ganun d maover pricing ng mga 2 hand distributor..pls ty
pos - Emerson De Jesus For example, the Belarus 921 model midsize tractor 4x4 awd model bare 102HP with cabin pumapalo ng 800K it comes with a high capacity 5 cyl turbocharged diesel engine which has options ng #yamz {russian engine}, #MMZD245 {belarusian engine maker and standard } at isuzu and fuso turbocharged diesel engines in its options, smaller 50 to 99hp and below tractor like the ones pareho. Laki ng kubota garden tractors na models nila ngayon nila play around 200k to 900k php without implements.. Check mo ang mga belarusian based delaers sa internet so you can have an idea of their prices as bare units halos 1/4th to 3 fifth mas mura ang presyo nila keysa mga brands na umiikot sa local market sa pinas of course mamahal yan kaunti coz of taxes
pos - Mijur Juris bro my stock n b sa pinas bro.. salamat sa info
pos - Emerson De Jesus not yet, #MTZBelarus nga is finding delaers and distributors at the moment this was posted, pero alam mo ba meron ng CIS na auto brands dito na gling Russia like Gazelle Motors,  sa Pasig na bumibenta ng #gazsadko #sk3308 UAZ Philippines na nasa Valenzuela City, Kamaz na ang delaer ay lifetruck sa malabon and MaZ Trucks and bus sa subic na kababayan na belarusian company ng MTZ Belarus tractors.. Wala pa pero lahat ng na mention ko na companies may available stocks at units with spares na..
pos - Mijur Juris nag pm aq sau sir! Bka mas mura ang 50hp lng need k sir, bka my contact ka sa knila sir,
pos - Emerson De Jesus i just checked the prices online and emailed some local delars sa #belarus, like Sir Pinol said nearest delar ay sa Cambodia, ako sa iyo sir maghintay tayo sa official na announcement ng #MTZBelarus o ng Department of agriculture kung sisimula na papasok sa pinas, like they say naghahanap pa sila ng local distributors at delaers sa ngayon
pos - Emerson De Jesus  please check this link po, http://www.belarus-tractor.com/en/dealers/cambodia/

pos - Julito Yranela  dont mind the model BELARUS-5022 na unit.. Tingnan mo ang iba dyan! Ying Belarus-421 nilang model ang tingnan mo.. Pang haciendero yang 5022 model nila natural.. Saka di lang yan limited sa farm use! Those tractors have a dual purpose function at kaya gawing industrial tractors
neg - Am dying to have one of these but how can afford bagsak copra . Pity

pos - Hi Sir MannyPiñol please ask the President and his economic team to recommend to Congress to open up the economy and remove the 60/40 ownership limits in our constitution so more FDI can come in the country and invest in our agriculture sector... Kindly check the CoRRECT Movement and I hope you can talk with Mr Orion Perez D about this advocacy. THANKS AND MORE POWER... Federal Parliament FDI People's Draft ABOLISH 60/40: LIBERATE PHILIPPINE ECONOMY, MARKET FRIENDLY PHILIPPINES
pos - Gabriel Lim kahit reverse lang 40/60 in favor of foreign country company ok na yan
neg - Al-musal adobo, dapat talaga walang restrictions na nakalagay sa constitution para at equal footing tayo with other countries esp. among our asean neighbors.  Sa ngayon dehado tayo sa perception ng mga fdi lalo pag ikinumpara tayo sa mga indonesia, vietnam, etc eh pareho namang may mataas na corruption sa mga yan.  Ipaubaya na lang dapat ang restriction sa legislation, na gaya din ng ginagawa ng ibang bansa.   Magkaiba yan ha, restrictions na nasa constitution vs restrictions via legislation.  Yung una nakataga sa bato, di nababago; yung huli mas flexible depende sa pangangailangan.
pos - Alvin Abitria agree... We should be competitive. Kahit nga sa southeast asia.. Kulelat tayo... We should follow singapore...
pos - Indonesia still imposes restrictions on ownership. In my perspective, this is necessary in order to protect the interest of local businesses. At 60/40 the foreign company or investors are already taking a sizeable stake in the company. The important thing is in the ease of doing business in the country, which our government is addressing.  Indonesia is managing its finances well, and the government owns many of the important business of the country.
